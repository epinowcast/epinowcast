### Breaking changes

### Bugs

### Package

- Exported
  [`enw_rolling_sum()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_rolling_sum.md)
  function for aggregating observations over timesteps. This function
  was previously internal but is needed for users working with non-daily
  reporting cycles. See
  [\#528](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/528) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Model

- Added support for structural reporting patterns in
  [`enw_report()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_report.md)
  via new helper functions
  [`enw_structural_reporting_metadata()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_structural_reporting_metadata.md)
  and
  [`enw_dayofweek_structural_reporting()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_dayofweek_structural_reporting.md).
  This enables modelling of non-daily reporting cycles (e.g., weekly)
  with a daily underlying generative model. Stan optimizations include
  precomputing sparse index lookups for aggregation operations to
  improve computational efficiency and numerical stability. See
  [\#528](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/528) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Documentation

### Deprecations

## epinowcast 0.4.0

This release adds a new use cases vignette to help users understand when
and how to apply the package to different problems. Documentation has
been enhanced with clearer guidance on the formula interface, including
details on fixed effects, random effects, and random walks, making the
package more accessible to users unfamiliar with formula syntax.

Performance improvements include optimised Stan functions, support for
sparse design matrices for memory-intensive models, and tightened priors
to improve run times. Experimental pathfinder support has been added for
rapid prototyping and informing initialisation of HMC runs. Model
enhancements include a negative binomial observation model with linear
mean-variance relationship and improved probability aggregation support.

The package lifecycle has been updated from experimental to stable, with
interface stability expected in this version.

The release has a single breaking change that fixes an off-by-one error
in
[`enw_filter_reference_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_reference_dates.md)
where `include_days = n` incorrectly returned `n + 1` dates. Functions
deprecated at version 0.4.0 or earlier have been removed.

A range of bug fixes have been implemented, including fixes for
[`enw_aggregate_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_aggregate_cumulative.md)
counting when the maximum delay is an even multiple of the timestep and
IDate storage mode compatibility with dplyr workflows.

Full details on changes in this release can be found in the following
sections or in the [GitHub release
notes](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

### Breaking changes

- Fixed off-by-one error in
  [`enw_filter_reference_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_reference_dates.md)
  where `include_days = n` incorrectly returned `n + 1` dates instead of
  exactly `n` dates. Now `include_days = 10` returns exactly 10
  reference dates, not 11. This brings the function behaviour in line
  with its documentation and user expectations. Users relying on the
  previous behaviour will need to adjust their `include_days` arguments
  by subtracting 1 to maintain the same date range. See issue
  [\#352](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/352) for
  details.
- Removed deprecated functions scheduled for removal at version 0.4.0 or
  earlier:
  - `enw_cumulative_to_incidence()` (deprecated 0.2.1, use
    [`enw_add_incidence()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_incidence.md))
  - `enw_incidence_to_cumulative()` (deprecated 0.2.1, use
    [`enw_add_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_cumulative.md))
  - `enw_delay_filter()` (deprecated 0.2.3, use
    [`enw_filter_delay()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_delay.md))
  - `enw_delay_metadata()` (deprecated 0.2.3, use
    [`enw_metadata_delay()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_metadata_delay.md))
  - `enw_score_nowcast()` (deprecated 0.4.0, use
    [`as_forecast_sample()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/reference/as_forecast_sample.html))
- Removed `simulate_double_censored_pmf()`. Users should use
  [`primarycensored::dprimarycensored()`](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/reference/dprimarycensored.html)
  instead for generating double censored PMFs.

### Bugs

- Fixed
  [`enw_aggregate_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_aggregate_cumulative.md)
  incorrectly counting when max_delay is an even multiple of the
  timestep. The function now completes dates before aggregation and adds
  missing incidence counts after aggregation to ensure cumulative sums
  are correctly calculated. Fixes
  [\#511](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/511).
- Fixed IDate storage mode error when using
  [`dplyr::filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)
  before
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md).
  The
  [`coerce_dt()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/coerce_dt.md)
  function now explicitly restores integer storage mode for IDate
  columns that may have been converted to double storage by dplyr
  operations whilst preserving the IDate class. This ensures
  compatibility with both dplyr and data.table workflows. Fixes
  [\#557](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/557).
- Fixed a bug where
  [`enw_nowcast_summary()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_nowcast_summary.md)
  and
  [`enw_nowcast_samples()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_nowcast_samples.md)
  incorrectly selected reference dates to include in their outputs when
  time steps were not days. See
  [\#473](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/473) by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian) and
  reviewed by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Fixed a bug where `enw_expose_stan_fns()` which has been deprecated
  was being used in the stan docs for `expected_obs()`. See
  [\#488](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/488) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Fixed error in
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  when processing data with predominantly zero counts across multiple
  groups. The function now handles sparse data gracefully and provides
  informative warnings when delay coverage statistics cannot be
  computed. See
  [\#541](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/541) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed stacked bar chart in Rt estimation vignette extending beyond
  actual reference date range. The plot now correctly limits the x-axis
  to the range of dates with data. See
  [\#634](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/634) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Package

- The package lifecycle has been updated from experimental to stable.
  The current interface has stabilised and users can expect interface
  stability in this version, though future major versions may include
  interface changes. See
  [\#370](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/370) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Experimental support for `CmdStanModel$pathfinder` has been added to
  the package via
  [`enw_pathfinder()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_pathfinder.md).
  This fitting method approximates the posterior distribution using a
  variational inference method. It may be useful for rapid prototyping,
  informing initialisation of HMC runs, and settings where compute time
  is limited. Likely downsides are poorly calibrated estimates and
  instability for more complex model formulations. See
  [\#464](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/464) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@medewitt](https://github.com/medewitt).
- Added support for initialising methods in
  [`enw_sample()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_sample.md).
  Currently this allows either the default “random” which draws from the
  priors (previously the only option) or “pathfinder” which approximates
  the posterior distribution using the pathfinder variational inference
  method. Currently this does not support initialising the mass matrix
  for HMC but will do once support is available in `cmdstan`. See
  [\#504](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/504) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jamesmbaazam](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam).
- Added checks for partial argument matching and fixed all instances.
  See [\#343](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/343) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Support for probability aggregation has been added to
  `expected_obs()`. See
  [\#482](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/482) by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian) and
  reviewed by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added actions to build precompiled actions both when updated and
  pushed to main and on a schedule. This aims to avoid issues where the
  precompiled actions are not up to date with the latest changes. See
  [\#494](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/494) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk).
- A new interface has been added to `scoringutils` to allow for scoring
  nowcasts. This is now available in `epinowcast` via
  [`as_forecast_sample()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/reference/as_forecast_sample.html).
  See [\#550](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/550) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Model

- Performance tuned `expected_obs()` and related functions to improve
  speed and reduce memory usage. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Used the `offset` and `multiplier` stan translation functions to
  improve the speed of the model. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Removed normalisation of truncated priors as this is not required
  during inference and increases run time. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Tightened the prior on the overdispersion parameter to provide less
  support to extreme overdispersion. This change is unlikely to impact
  results for most users but should help to improve run time. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Optimised internal performance critical stan functions to improve
  speed and reduce memory usage. See
  [\#513](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/513) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Added support for sparse design matrices to the model (see
  `sparse_design` in
  [`enw_fit_opts()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_fit_opts.md)).
  For very sparse design matrices this can reduce memory requirements
  and computation time. A heuristic has been added to inform users if
  sparse design matrices are useful for you. See
  [\#514](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/514) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Added support for a negative binomial observation model with a linear
  mean-variance relationship as an option of the `model_obs` argument of
  [`epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/epinowcast.md).
  See [\#590](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/590) by
  [@barbora-sobolova](https://github.com/barbora-sobolova) and reviewed
  by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Documentation

- Clarified in
  [`enw_aggregate_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_aggregate_cumulative.md)
  documentation that observations where report dates do not form a
  complete timestep will be dropped from the aggregated output. This
  behaviour is by design to ensure consistent timestep alignment.
  Addresses
  [\#427](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/427).
- Improved documentation of the formula interface to make it more
  accessible to users unfamiliar with formula syntax. Enhanced
  [`enw_formula()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_formula.md)
  documentation with details on fixed effects, random effects (lme4
  syntax), and random walks, including explanation of the `~0`
  convention for disabling model components and how formulas map to
  model structure. Added references to relevant R resources and expanded
  examples. Updated model module documentation
  ([`enw_reference()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_reference.md),
  [`enw_report()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_report.md),
  [`enw_expectation()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_expectation.md),
  [`enw_missing()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_missing.md))
  to clarify formula usage and cross-reference the main formula
  documentation. Addresses
  [\#468](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/468) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Linked the Stan function documentation to the package website. By
  [@jamesmbaazam](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam) in
  [\#529](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/529) and
  reviewed by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added support to render and deploy stan documentation using `doxygen`
  and a GitHub Actions workflow. See
  [\#500](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/500) and
  [\#502](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/502) by
  [@jamesmbaazam](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) respectively, and cross-reviewed.
- Standardised punctuation in the `pkgdown` reference. See
  [\#458](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/458) by
  [@athowes](https://github.com/athowes) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Reduced the `adapt_delta` and `max_treedepth` arguments in the
  vignettes and examples and tested to see that this did not impact the
  results. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Made vignette progress messaging dependent on the user being
  interactive. See
  [\#501](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/501) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@jessalynnsebastian](https://github.com/jessalynnsebastian).
- Added a vignette to document package use cases. See
  [\#524](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/524) by
  [@kaitejohnson](https://github.com/kaitejohnson) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Switched to using
  [primarycensored](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org) for
  simulating the primary censored and right truncated processes needed
  to correctly model the discrete delays. See
  [\#549](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/549) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Deprecations

- `enw_score_nowcast()` has been deprecated in favour of
  [`scoringutils::score()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/reference/score.html).
  See [\#550](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/550) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

## epinowcast 0.3.0

This release brings a range of enhancements, new features, and bug
fixes, reflecting the effort of a large number of contributors. It has a
single breaking change, which adjusts the default `max_delay` parameter
in `enw_process_data()` to be the maximum observed delay in the input
data. This change aims to encourage users to tailor this setting to
their specific datasets and to give them a more reasonable default if
they do not.

The package infrastructure has also had significant updates, including
improved search functionality on the `pkgdown` website, the adoption of
an organization-level `pkgdown` theme, the ability to cache Stan models
across R sessions, and additional continuous integration tests.

Model enhancements include updated internal handling of PMF
discretization and support for non-parametric reference date models,
alongside documentation improvements that provide clearer guidance and
examples for users.

A range of bug fixes have been implemented, including a fix for a bug in
the
[`enw_expectation()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_expectation.md)
module that was causing issues with models containing multiple time
series.

Full details on the changes in this release can be found in the
following sections or in the [GitHub release
notes](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.3.0). To
see the development timeline of this release see the [`0.3.0`
project](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/1).

### Breaking changes

- The default of `max_delay` in `enw_process_data()` has been changed to
  be the maximum observed delay in the input data rather than being 20
  days. When this default is used a warning is now thrown and in general
  users should be setting this based on their data and application. See
  the documentation of
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  for more details. See
  [\#224](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/224) by
  [@adrianlison](https://github.com/adrianlison) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Bugs

- Fixed a bug identified by [@jbracher](https://github.com/jbracher)
  where the
  [`enw_expectation()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_expectation.md)
  module was not appropriately defining initial conditions when multiple
  groups were present. This issue was related to recent changes in
  `cmdstan 2.32.1` and is required in order to use versions of `cmdstan`
  beyond `2.32.0` with models that contain multiple time series. See
  [\#282](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/282) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed a few typos in the model vignette. See
  [\#292](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/292) by
  [@medewitt](https://github.com/medewitt) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Fixed a bug where snapshots (i.e. as returned as metadata in
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md))
  were defined based on report vs reference date. This won’t have
  impacted most usage but was a problem when trying to fit a model to
  retrospective (and so completely reported) data. See
  [\#312](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/312) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed a bug where a non-`data.table` passed to
  `enw_quantile_to_long()` could throw an error. See
  [\#324](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/324) by
  [@natemcintosh](https://github.com/natemcintosh) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Fixed a bug where
  [`enw_aggregate_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_aggregate_cumulative.md)
  initialised its time step from the first reference date + 1 day rather
  than the first reference date. See
  [\#336](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/336) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed a bug in `enw_filter_reference_dates` when using `remove_days`
  on data with missing reference dates. See
  [\#351](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/351) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Resolved code quality issues related to the use of `%in%` with a scale
  on the right hand side and other similar issues. See
  [\#382](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/382) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo).

### Package

- Search functionality on pkgdown website no longer directs to
  non-existent pages. This issue resulted from an incorrect URL being
  specified in the pkgdown configuration file. See
  [\#449](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/449) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo), based on a report from
  [@zsusswein](https://github.com/zsusswein).
- `pkgdown` theming elements have moved to an [organization-level
  `pkgdown` theme](https://github.com/epinowcast/enwtheme) to increase
  re-usability and
  [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)-ness across
  the organization. See
  [\#419](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/419) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- `lintr` checks are now run also on the `tests/` directory. See
  [\#418](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/418) by

- Fixed some typos in `single-timeseries-rt-estimation.Rmd`. The
  `WORDLIST` used by spelling has also been updated to eliminate false
  positives. Future typos will now generate an error in the continuous
  integration check so that we can catch them as early as possible. See

  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added extra checks in continuous integration tests: we now test that
  partial matching is not used and that global state is left unchanged
  (or restored correctly). See

  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added additional tests to ensure that the
  [`enw_expectation()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_expectation.md)
  module is appropriately defining initial conditions when multiple
  groups are present. See
  [\#282](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/282) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added an integration test for
  [`epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/epinowcast.md)
  to check models with multiple time series can be fit as expected on
  example data. See
  [\#282](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/282) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added a `{touchstone}` benchmark that includes multiple time-series to
  ensure that this functionality is appropriately tested. See

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added the `merge_group` option to all required GitHub Actions. This
  enables the use of a merge queue for pull requests. See
  [\#300](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/300) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added an internal
  [`check_group_date_unique()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/check_group_date_unique.md)
  function which ensures that user supplied groups result in unique
  combinations of group and dates. This function is used in
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  and
  [`enw_complete_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_complete_dates.md)
  to ensure that the user supplied groups are valid. See
  [\#295](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/295) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added support for non-daily reference date models (i.e., process
  models). For example, this allows modelling weekly data as weekly.
  This may be desirable when delays are very long, when computational
  resources are limited, or it is not possible to specify a sufficiently
  flexible daily model to account for observed reporting patterns in
  either reference or report dates. As the model is unit less this
  entails no changes to the model itself. See
  [\#303](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/303) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added a new helper function `simulate_double_censored_pmf()` which
  helps users define “correct” probability mass functions for double
  censored delays based on work in `epidist` by
  [@parksw3](https://github.com/parksw3) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs). Note this function is likely to
  be spun out into its own package in the near future. See
  [\#312](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/312) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added a `min_reference_date` argument to
  [`enw_aggregate_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_aggregate_cumulative.md)
  to allow users to specify the minimum reference date to include in the
  output. This is useful when users want to aggregate to a timestep with
  a specified initialisation date that is not the default. For example
  if users data is already reported with a weekly cadence they would use
  `min(data$report_date) + 1` to preserve that timestep. See
  [\#340](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/340) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@natemcintosh](https://github.com/natemcintosh).
- Added support to
  [`enw_complete_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_complete_dates.md)
  for `min_date` and `max_date` arguments. These arguments allow users
  to specify the minimum and maximum dates to include in the output.
  This may be useful to users who want to ensure that their data is
  complete for a specified time period. See
  [\#340](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/340) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@natemcintosh](https://github.com/natemcintosh).
- Added a new helper function
  [`enw_one_hot_encode_feature()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_one_hot_encode_feature.md)
  for one hot encoding variables and binding them into the original
  data. This is useful when users want to include parts of variables in
  their models as binary indicators - for example giving a specific
  delay its own effect. See
  [\#348](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/348) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Enabled compiling with multithreading by default as this was found to
  cause no deterioration in performance even with 1 thread per chain.
  The likelihood calculation is now no longer parallelised when
  `threads_per_chain = 1` which should offer a small performance
  improvement. See
  [\#366](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/366) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added a new action to check that the `cmdstan` model can be compiled
  and has the correct syntax. This runs on pull requests whenever stan
  code is changed, when code is merged onto `main` with altered stan
  code, and on a weekly schedule against the latest `main` branch. See
  [\#386](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/386) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Switched to the [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org) package for all package
  messaging in order to have modern and pretty notifications. See

  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Increased the minimum supported R version to \>= R 3.6.0 from R 3.5.0
  and ensured that existing function code and tests compiled with this
  dependency. Vignettes will continue to allow use of R \>= 4.1.0 syntax
  (i.e., native pipe and lambda function syntax). See

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk).
- Added a function
  [`check_max_delay()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/check_max_delay.md)
  which allows to obtain coverage statistics for the assumed maximum
  delay based on the observed data. Enhanced postprocessing functions to
  accept a different max_delay than used in the model, by adding
  artificial samples/summaries for not-modeled dates. Further improved
  documentation and warnings around `max_delay`. See
  [\#224](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/224) by

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Exposed
  [`enw_stan_to_r()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_stan_to_r.md)
  to the user. This function is used for testing and in development to
  expose [epinowcast](https://package.epinowcast.org) stan code in R.
  Users may find this function useful as it allows them to explore the
  stan code used in [epinowcast](https://package.epinowcast.org) models
  more easily. Note that this functionality is known to be unstable when
  [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) is loaded in the same R session.

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk).
- Refactored
  [`extract_sparse_matrix()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/extract_sparse_matrix.md)
  to allow us to drop our [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/)
  dependency. See

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk).
- Allow for caching Stan models across R sessions to reduce compilation
  time through the use of the environment variable,
  `enw_cache_location`, which can be set using the `set_enw_cache()`
  function. See
  [\#407](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/407) by

### Model

- Update the internal handling of PMF discretisation to assume a uniform
  window of two days centred on the delay of interest rather than a
  window of one day starting on the delay of interest. This better
  approximates the underlying continuous distribution with primary and
  secondary event censoring. Due to this change models may perform
  slightly differently between versions and any delay distribution
  estimates will have means that are half a day longer (note this
  corrects the previous bias). See
  [\#288](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/288) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Updated the default prior for initialising the model to include the
  ascertainment rate which is inferred from the latent reporting delay
  distribution as this can be an improper probability mass function
  (i.e. one that does not sum to 1). See
  [\#312](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/312) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added support for non-parametric reference date models as well as
  mixed models with both parametric and non-parametric reference date
  models. This enables the use of popular models such as the discrete
  time cox proportional hazards model. See
  [\#313](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/313) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added support for missing data (excluding in the missing reference
  date model) using the `observation_indicator` argument to
  [`enw_obs()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_obs.md).
  Support was also added to
  [`enw_complete_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_complete_dates.md)
  to flag missing data and as part of this new helper functions
  ([`enw_flag_observed_observations()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_flag_observed_observations.md)
  and
  [`enw_impute_na_observations()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_impute_na_observations.md))
  were also added. This support is likely most useful when used in
  conjunction to a known reporting structure. See
  [\#327](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/327) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added support for using a maximum delay that is longer than the
  largest observed delay in the data. This may be useful at the start of
  an outbreak, when the data is sparse and the user expects delays
  longer than what has been observed so far. Note that because this
  requires extrapolating the delay distribution beyond the support of
  the data, users should be cautious when using this feature. A new
  example, `inst/examples/germany_max_delay_greater_than_data.R`, has
  been added to demonstrate this feature. See

  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added the priors used for model fitting to the `<epinowcast>` object.
  The object returned by
  [`epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/epinowcast.md)
  now has a variable called `priors` and can be accessed for inspection
  and downstream analyses. See

  `flatly` theme for `pkgdown` rather than the `preferably` theme. See
  [\#312](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/312) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

  as an option and also added a new example showing how to use this
  model. See

  weekly with a 3 day delay until any reports are non-zero with a weekly
  process model and a mixture of a parametric and non-parametric
  reference date model. See
  [\#348](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/348) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Split README to focus on package-level issues and moved quick start
  into a getting started vignette. See

  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and reviewed by
  [@jamesmbaazam](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added code in the `CITATION` file to automatically pull relevant
  citation fields from the `DESCRIPTION` file. Also added a GitHub
  Actions workflow to auto-generate a `citation.cff` file whenever
  `CITATION` or `DESCRIPTION` change. This way, all three files will
  always be up to date. See

- Removed the reference in the pull request template to updating the
  development version as this has been found to cause issues when
  multiple pull requests are open at once. See

### Deprecations

- `enw_delay_filter()`: Deprecated with a warning in favour of
  [`enw_filter_delay()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_delay.md).
  This renaming is to better reflect the function’s purpose. See

## epinowcast 0.2.2

This is a minor release that fixes a bug in the handling of optional
initial conditions that was introduced by a recent change in
`cmdstan 2.32.1`. Upgrading is recommended for all users who wish to use
versions of `cmdstan` beyond `2.32.0`. In addition to fixing this issue,
the release also includes some minor documentation and vignette
improvements, along with enhancements in input checking.

contributed to discussions that led to improvements in this release.

### Bugs

- Improved the handling of optional initial conditions so that they are
  consistently passed as arrays to stan as required by `cmdstan 2.32.1`.
  This fix is required in order to use versions of `cmdstan` beyond
  `2.32.0`. See
  [\#276](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/276) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

### Package

- Added input checking for `max_delay` in
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  to ensure that the maximum delay is greater than or equal to 1 and
  that it can be coerced to be an integer. See

### Documentation

- Improved the discrete delay distributions vignette including escaping
  functions to improve readibility and right-closing discretised bins.

## epinowcast 0.2.1

In this release, we focused on improving the internal code structure,
documentation, and development infrastructure of the package to make it
easier to maintain and extend functionality in the future. We also fixed
a number of bugs and made some minor improvements to the interface.
These changes included extending test and documentation coverage across
all package functions, improving internal data checking and
internalization, and removing some deprecated functions.

While these changes are not expected to impact most users, we recommend
that all users upgrade to this version. We also suggest that users who
have fitted models with both random effects and random walks should
refit these models and compare the output to previous fits in order to
understand the impact of a bug in the specification of these models that
was fixed in this release.

This release lays the groundwork for planned features in
[`0.3.0`](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/1) and
[`0.4.0`](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/2) including:
support for non-parametric delays, non-daily data with a non-daily
process model (i.e. weekly data with a weekly process model), additional
flexibility specifying generation times and latent reporting delays,
improved case studies, and adding support for forecasting.

Full details on the changes in this release can be found in the
following sections or in the [GitHub release
notes](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.2.1). To
see the development timeline of this release see the [`0.2.1`
project](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/projects/3).

### Potentially breaking changes

- [`enw_add_pooling_effect()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_pooling_effect.md):
  replaced `string` argument with `...` argument, to enable passing
  arbitrary arguments to the `finder_fn` argument. The same general
  usage is supported, but now e.g. the default argument to supply is
  `prefix = "somevalue"` vs `string = "somevalue"` and argument
  positions have changed. This function is primarily for internal use
  and we expect only a small subset of advanced users who are creating
  models outside the currently supported formula interface to be
  impacted See
  [\#222](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/222) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- `enw_dates_to_factors()`: Deprecated and removed as no longer needed.
  We expect this function had little to no external use and so there
  should be little impact on users. See
  [\#216](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/216) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by

### Bugs

- Fixed a bug first highlighted by [@Gulfa](https://github.com/Gulfa) in
  [\#166](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/166) and
  localised during the investigation for
  [\#223](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/223) where
  random effects and random walks were being improperly constructed in
  [`enw_formula()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_formula.md)
  so that their variances parameters were not shared between the correct
  parameters when used together. This only impacts models that used
  formulas with both random effects and random walks and for these
  models appears to have led to increased run-times, fitting issues, and
  potentially unreliable posterior estimates but to have had a less
  significant impact on actual nowcasts. We suggest refitting these
  models and comparing the output to previous fits in order to
  understand the impact on your usage. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

  [`enw_replace_priors()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_replace_priors.md)
  where the function could not deal with `epinowcast` summarised
  posterior estimates due to the new use of the `pillar` class. Added
  tests to catch if this issue reoccurs in the future. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed an issue
  ([\#198](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/198)) with
  the interface for `scoringutils`. For an unknown reason our example
  data contained `pillar` classes (likely due to an upstream change).
  This caused an issue with internal `scoringutils` that was using
  implicit type conversion (see
  [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/pull/274)). See
  [\#201](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/201) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Fixed a bug in
  [`enw_plot_quantiles()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_plot_quantiles.md)
  where the documented default for `log` was `FALSE` but the actual
  default was `TRUE`. See
  [\#209](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/209) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Fixed a bug in
  [`enw_expectation()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_expectation.md)
  where when models were specified with zero intercept a initial
  condition was still being specified for the intercept of the growth
  rate (`expr_r_int`,
  [\#246](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/246)). This
  was not flagged as an issue by `cmdstan 2.31.0` but as of
  `cmdstan 2.32.0`, due to improvements in how initial conditions were
  being read in
  ([stan-dev/stan#3182](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues/3182)),
  it throws an error causing models to fail. Solution suggested by
  [@WardBrian](https://github.com/WardBrian), implemented in
  [\#255](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/255) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs), and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).

### Deprecations

- `enw_incidence_to_cumulative()`: Deprecated with a warning in favour
  of
  [`enw_add_cumulative()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_cumulative.md).
  This renaming is to better reflect the function’s purpose.
  `enw_incidence_to_cumulative()` will be removed in `0.3.0`. See
  [\#247](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/247) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- `enw_cumulative_to_incidence()`: Deprecated with a warning in favour
  of
  [`enw_add_incidence()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_incidence.md).
  This renaming is to better reflect the function’s purpose.
  `enw_cumulative_to_incidence()` will be removed in `0.3.0`. See

### Package

- Fixed some typos in `README.md`, `NEWS.md`, the `model.Rmd` vignette
  and
  [`convolution_matrix()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/convolution_matrix.md)
  documentation. The `WORDLIST` used by spelling has also been updated
  by eliminate false positives. See
  [\#221](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/221) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added more non-default linters in `.lintr` configuration file. This
  file is used when `lintr::lint_package()` is run or in the new
  `lint-changed-files.yaml` GitHub Actions workflow. See
  [\#220](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/220) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Switched to the `lint-changed-files.yaml` GitHub Actions workflow
  instead of the regular `lint.yaml` to avoid annotations unrelated to
  the changes made in the PR. See
  [\#220](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/220) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added tests for
  [`summary.epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/summary.epinowcast.md)
  and
  [`plot.epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/plot.epinowcast.md)
  methods. See
  [\#209](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/209) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Added tests for
  [`enw_plot_obs()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_plot_obs.md)
  where not otherwise covered by
  [`plot.epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/plot.epinowcast.md)
  tests. See
  [\#209](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/209) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Refactored to consolidate data checking and internalization into a
  single internal function
  [`coerce_dt()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/coerce_dt.md),
  addressing issues
  [\#242](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/242),
  [\#241](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/241),
  [\#214](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/214), and
  [\#149](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/149). This
  eliminates the need for `add_group()`, `check_by()`, and
  `check_dates()` (and associated documentation, tests - some of these
  were intermediate capabilities introduced within this minor version;
  see [\#208](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/208))
  which have all been removed. Also starts to enable internal versus
  external use of exposed methods with the `copy = ...` argument. See
  [\#239](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/239) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca), reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Resolved the spurious test warnings for snapshot tests which were
  linked to unstated formatting requirements. See
  [\#208](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/208) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Removed unused internal plot helpers. See
  [\#217](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/217) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added tests for all internal `check_` functions used to check inputs.
  See [\#217](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/217) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Removed the problematic double specification of default arguments for
  `target_date` in
  [`enw_metadata()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_metadata.md)
  as flagged in
  [\#212](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/212) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) using
  [`formals()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/formals.html) to instead detect
  the default values from the function specification. See
  [\#232](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/232) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- In the words of Jenny Bryan: “there is no else, there is only if.”
  Having else after [`return()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html)
  of [`stop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/stop.html) increases the number
  of branches in the code, which makes it harder to read. It also
  translates into a higher cyclomatic complexity. We have removed all
  else statements after
  [`return()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html) and
  [`stop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/stop.html) in the package. See
  [\#229](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/229) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and reviewed by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Removed the internal definition of `no_contrasts` in
  [`enw_formula()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_formula.md)
  as this was unused. Identified by
  [@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo) in
  [\#220](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/220) and
  raised in
  [\#223](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/223). See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added tests for
  [`enw_replace_priors()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_replace_priors.md)
  to check that it can handle `epinowcast` summarised posterior
  estimates. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added a prefix (`rw__`) in
  [`enw_formula()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_formula.md)
  and
  [`construct_rw()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/construct_rw.md)
  to indicate when a random effect variance is a random walk versus a
  random effect. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by.
- Added support for using the same variable as both a random effect and
  a random walk. In most settings this is not advised. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added an error message to
  [`construct_rw()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/construct_rw.md)
  when a random walk is specified for a variable that is not a numeric
  variable. See
  [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.
- Added support for preprocessing and model fitting benchmarking using
  `touchstone` based on the implementation in `EpiNow2` by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk). See
  [\#200](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/200) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs),
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison),
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk), and self-reviewed.
- Added a complete set of data converters to map between line list
  (i.e. each row is a case) and count data (i.e incidence and cumulative
  counts by reference and report date). In particular, this will help
  workflows where individual line list data is available as it can now
  be formatted ready for preprocessing using a single call to
  [`enw_linelist_to_incidence()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_linelist_to_incidence.md)
  which previously took several steps. See
  [\#247](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/247) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@jhellewell14](https://github.com/jhellewell14) and reviewed by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Dropped the use of the `develop` branch for development versions of
  the package. This change was discussed in
  [\#250](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/250) with the
  major motivator being that since the introduction of release only
  builds to R Universe we no longer need to have a stable `main` branch
  of GitHub to control our releases. See
  [\#256](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/256) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and reviewed by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) and
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Cleaned enw_formula_as_data_list() to better align with DRY
  principles. See

  [`enw_replace_priors()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_replace_priors.md)
  showing how to use a nowcast posterior to update the default priors.
  See [\#228](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/228) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and self-reviewed.

- Improved and extended documentation of discretized, parametric delay
  distributions. Changed structure of package vignettes (into two
  categories, model definition vignettes and case study vignettes). See

## epinowcast 0.2.0

This release adds several extensions to our modelling framework,
including modelling of missing data, flexible modelling of the
generative process underlying case counts, an optional renewal
equation-based generative process (enabling direct estimation of the
effective reproduction number), and convolution-based latent reporting
delays (enabling the modelling of both directly observed and unobserved
delays as well as partial ascertainment). Much of the methodology used
in these extensions is based on [work done by Adrian
Lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison/nowcast-transmission) and is
currently being evaluated.

On top of model extensions this release also adds a range of quality of
life features, such as a helper functions for constructing convolution
matrices and combining probability mass functions. It also comes with
improved computational efficiency, thanks to a refactoring of the hazard
model computations to the log scale and extended parallelisation of the
likelihood that is optimised for the structure of the input data. We
have also extended the package documentation and streamlined the
contribution process.

As a large-scale project, the package remains in an experimental state,
though it is sufficiently stable for both research and production usage.
More core development is needed to improve post-processing,
pre-processing, documentation coverage, and evaluate optimal
configurations in different settings) please see our [community
site](https://community.epinowcast.org/), [contributing
guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and list of [issues/proposed
features](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues) if interested
in being involved (any scale of contribution is warmly welcomed
including user feedback, requests to extend our functionality to cover
your setting, and evaluating the package for your context). This is a
community project that needs support from its users in order to provide
improved tools for real-time infectious disease surveillance.

Full details on the changes in this release can be found in the
following sections.

### Package

- Added `.Rhistory` to the `.gitignore` file. See
  [\#132](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/132) by
  [@choi-hannah](https://github.com/choi-hannah).
- Fixed indentations for authors and contributors in the `DESCRIPTION`
  file. See [\#132](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/132)
  by [@choi-hannah](https://github.com/choi-hannah).
- Renamed `enw_new_reports()` to `enw_cumulative_to_incidence()` and
  added the reverse function `enw_incidence_to_cumulative()` both
  functions use a `by` argument to allow specification of variable
  groupings. See
  [\#157](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/157) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Switched class checking to `inherits(x, "class")` rather than
  `class(x) %in% "class"`. See
  [\#155](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/155) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo).
- Changed
  [`enw_add_metaobs_features()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_metaobs_features.md)
  interface to have `holidays` argument as a series of dates. Changed
  interface of
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  to pass `...` to
  [`enw_add_metaobs_features()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_add_metaobs_features.md).
  Interface changes come with internal rewrite and unit tests. As part
  of internal rewrite, introduces
  [`coerce_date()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/coerce_date.md)
  to `R/utils.R`, which wraps
  [`data.table::as.IDate()`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/IDateTime.html)
  with error handling. See
  [\#151](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/151) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Changed the style of using `match.arg` for validating inputs. Briefly,
  the preference is now to define options via function arguments and
  validate with automatic `match.arg` idiom with corresponding
  enumerated documentation of the options. For this idiom, the first
  item in the definition is the default. This approach only applies to
  string-based arguments; different types of arguments cannot be matched
  this way, nor can arguments that allow for vector-valued options
  (e.g., if `somearg = c("option1", "option2")` were a legal argument
  indicating to use both options). See
  [\#162](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/162) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca) addressing issue
  [\#156](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/156) by
  [@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo).
- Refined the use of data ordering throughout the preprocessing
  functions. See
  [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Skipped tests that use `cmdstan` locally to improve the
  developer/contributor experience. See
  [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added a basic simulator function for missing reference data. See
  [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added support for right hand side interactions as syntax sugar for
  random effects. This allows the specification of, for example,
  independent random effects by day for each strata of another variable.
  See [\#169](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/169) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added support for passing `cpp_options` to
  [`cmdstanr::cmdstan_model()`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/cmdstan_model.html).
  See [\#182](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/182) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Add a function,
  [`convolution_matrix()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/convolution_matrix.md)
  for constructing convolution matrices. See
  [\#183](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/183) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Add a pass through from
  [`enw_model()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_model.md)
  to
  [`write_stan_files_no_profile()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/write_stan_files_no_profile.md)
  for the `target_dir` argument. This allows users to compile the model
  once and then share the compiled model across sessions rather than
  having to recompile each time the temporary directory is cleared. See
  [\#185](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/185) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added
  [`add_pmfs()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/add_pmfs.md),
  to sum probability mass functions into a new probability mass
  function. Initial implementation by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) in
  [\#183](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/183),
  refactored by [@pratikunterwegs](https://github.com/pratikunterwegs)
  in [\#187](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/187),
  following a suggestion in issue
  [\#186](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/186) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- Added a warning when the observed empirical maximum delay is less than
  the specified maximum delay. See
  [\#190](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/190) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added nested support for converting array syntax in
  `convert_cmdstan_to_rstan`. See
  [\#192](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/192) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk).

### Model

- Added support for parametric log-logistic delay distributions. See
  [\#128](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/128) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Implemented direct specification of parametric baseline hazards. See
  [\#134](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/134) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Refactored the observation model, the combination of logit hazards,
  and the effects priors to be contained in generic functions to make
  extending package functionality easier. See
  [\#137](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/137) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Implemented specification of the parametric baseline hazards and
  probabilities on the log scale to increase robustness and efficiency.
  Also includes refactoring of these functions and reorganisation of
  `inst/stan/epinowcast.stan` to increase modularity and clarity. See
  [\#140](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/140) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Introduced two new delay likelihoods `delay_snap_lmpf` and
  `delay_group_lmpf`. These stratify by either snapshots or groups. This
  is helpful for some models (such as the missingness module). The
  ability to choose which function is used has been exposed to the user
  in
  [`enw_fit_opts()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_fit_opts.md)
  via the `likelihood_aggregation` argument. Both of these functions
  rely on a newly added `expected_obs_from_snaps` function which
  vectorises `expected_obs_from_index`. See
  [\#138](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/138) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added support for supplying missingness model parameters to the model
  as well as optional priors and effect estimation. See
  [\#138](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/138) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Refactored model generated quantities to be functional. See
  [\#138](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/138) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added support for modelling missing reference dates to the likelihood.
  See [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added additional functionality to `delay_group_lmpf` to support
  modelling observations missing reference dates. Also updated the
  generated quantities to support this mode. See
  [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) based on
  [\#64](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/64) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added a flexible expectation process on the growth rate scale. The
  default expectation model has been updated to a group-wise random walk
  on the growth rate. See
  [\#152](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/152) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added a deterministic renewal equation, and latent reporting process.
  See [\#152](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/152) and
  [\#183](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/183) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added support for no intercept in the expectation model and more
  general formula support to enable this as a feature in other modules
  going forward. See
  [\#170](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/170) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Documentation

- Removed explicit links to authors and issues in the `NEWS.md` file.
  See [\#132](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/132) by
  [@choi-hannah](https://github.com/choi-hannah).
- Added a new example using simulated data and the
  [`enw_missing()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_missing.md)
  model module. See
  [\#138](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/138) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Update the model definition vignette to include the missing reference
  date model. See
  [\#147](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/147) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) and
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).
- Added the use of an expectation model to the “Hierarchical nowcasting
  of age stratified COVID-19 hospitalisations in Germany” vignette. See
  [\#193](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/193) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Bugs

- The probability-only model (i.e only a parametric distribution is used
  and hence the hazard scale is not needed) was not used due to a
  mistake specifying `ref_as_p` in the stan code. There was an
  additional issue in that the
  [`enw_report()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_report.md)
  module currently self-declares as on regardless of it is or not. This
  bug had no impact on results but would have increased runtimes for
  simple models. Both of these issues were fixed in
  [\#142](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/142) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- The addition of meta features week and month did not properly
  sequentially number weeks and months when time series crossed year
  boundaries. This would impact models that included effects expecting
  those to in fact be sequentially numbered (e.g. random walks). Fixed
  in [\#151](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/151) by
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).
- \#151 also corrects a minor issue with
  [`enw_example()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_example.md)
  pointing at an old file name when `type="script"`. By
  [@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca).

## epinowcast 0.1.0

This is a major release focusing on improving the user experience, and
preparing for future package extensions, with an increase in modularity,
development of a flexible and full-featured formula interface, and
hopefully future-proofing as far as possible. This prepares the ground
for future model extensions which will allow a broad range of real-time
infectious disease questions to be better answered. These extensions
include:

- Modelling missing data
  ([\#43](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/43)).
- Non-parametric modelling of delay and reference date logit hazard
  ([\#4](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/4)).
- Flexible expectation modelling
  ([\#5](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/5)).
- Forecasting beyond the horizon of the data
  ([\#3](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/3)).
- Known reporting structures
  ([\#33](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/33)).
- Renewal equation-based reproduction number estimation (potentially
  part of [\#5](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/5)).
- Latent infections (i.e as implemented in other packages such as
  `EpiNow2`, `epidemia`, etc.).
- Convolution-based delay models (i.e hospitalisations and deaths) with
  partially reported data.
- Additional observation models.

If interested in contributing to these features, or other aspects of
package development (for example improving post-processing, the coverage
of documentation, or contributing case studies) please see our
[contributing
guide](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/CONTRIBUTING.html) and/or just
reach out. This is a community project that needs support from its users
in order to provide improved tools for real-time infectious disease
surveillance.

This release contains multiple breaking changes. If needing the old
interface please install [`0.0.7` from
GitHub](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.0.7).
For ease, we have stratified changes below into interface, package,
documentation, and model changes. Note the package is still flagged as
experimental but is in regular use by the authors.

[@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison),
[@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk), and
[@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs) contributed to this release.

### Interface

- A fully featured and flexible formula interface has been added that
  allows the specification of fixed effects, `lme4` random effects, and
  random walks. See
  [\#27](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/27) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- A major overhaul, as described in
  [\#57](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/57), to the
  interface of
  [`epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/epinowcast.md)
  with a particular focus on improving the modularity of the model
  components (described as modules in the documentation). All of the
  package documentation and vignettes have been updated to reflect this
  new interface. See
  [\#112](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/112) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Package

- Renamed the package and updated the description to give more clarity
  about the problem space it focusses on. See
  [\#110](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/110) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- A new helper function `enw_delay_metadata()` has been added. This
  produces metadata about the delay distribution vector that may be
  helpful in future modelling. This prepares the way for
  [\#4](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/4) where this
  `data.frame` will be combined with the reference metadata in order to
  build non-parametric hazard reference and delay-based models. In
  addition to adding this function, it has also been added to the output
  of
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  in order to make the metadata readily available to end-users. See
  [\#80](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/80) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Two new helper functions
  [`enw_filter_reference_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_reference_dates.md)
  and
  [`enw_filter_report_dates()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_filter_report_dates.md)
  have been added. These replace `enw_retrospective_data()` but allow
  users to similarly construct retrospective data. Splitting these
  functions out into components also allows for additional use cases
  that were not previously possible. Note that by definition it is
  assumed that a report date for a given reference date must be equal or
  greater (i.e a report cannot happen before the event being reported
  occurs). See
  [\#82](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/82) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- The internal grouping variables have been refactored to reduce the
  chance of clashes with columns in the data.frames supplied by the
  user. There will also be an error thrown in case of a variable clash,
  making preprocessing safer. See
  [\#102](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/102) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs), which solves
  [\#99](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/99).
- Support for preprocessing observations with missing reference dates
  has been added along with a new data object returned by
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  that highlights this information to the user (alternatively can be
  accessed by users using
  [`enw_missing_reference()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_missing_reference.md)).
  In addition, these missing observations have been setup to be passed
  to stan in order to allow their use in modelling. This feature is in
  preparation of adding full support for missing observations (see
  [\#43](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/43)). See
  [\#106](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/106) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- The discretised reporting probability function has been extended to
  handle delays beyond the maximum delay in three different ways:
  ignore, add to maximum, or normalize. The nowcasting model uses
  “normalise” though work on this is ongoing. See
  [\#113](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/113) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [\#121](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/121) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Fixed an issue
  ([\#105](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/105)) with
  `cmdstan 2.30.0` where passing optimisation flags to `stanc_options`
  by default was causing a compilation error by not passing these flags
  by default. See
  [\#117](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/117) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Addition of regression/integration tests against example data for
  [`epinowcast()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/epinowcast.md)
  and
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md)
  with convergence checking for several example nowcasting models. Lower
  level tests for model tools and model modules have also been added.
  See [\#112](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/112) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Model

- Added support for parametric exponential delay distributions (note
  that this is comparable to an intercept-only non-parametric hazard
  model) and potentially no parametric delay (though this will currently
  throw an error due to the lack of appropriate non-parametric hazard).
  See [\#84](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/84) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Added support for a Poisson observation model though it is recommended
  that most users make use of the default negative binomial model. See
  [\#120](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/120) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Updated the expectation random walk model to use a more efficient
  `cumulative_sum` implementation suggested by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) in
  [\#98](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/98). See
  [\#103](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/103) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Aligned the implementation of the overdispersion prior with the prior
  choice recommendations from the [stan
  wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations).
  See [\#111](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/111) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison).

### Documentation

- The model description has been updated to reflect the currently
  implemented model and to improve readability. The use of reference and
  report date nomenclature has also been standardised across the
  package. See
  [\#71](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/71) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

### Internals

- Array declarations in the stan model have been updated. To maintain
  compatibility with `expose_stan_fns()` (which itself depends on
  `rstan`), additional functionality has been added to parse stan code
  in this function. See
  [\#74](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/74),
  [\#85](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/85), and
  [\#93](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/93) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Remove spurious warnings due to missing initial values for optional
  parameters. See
  [\#76](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/76) by
  [@sbfnk](https://github.com/sbfnk) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).

## epinowcast 0.0.7

- Adds additional quality of life data processing so that the maximum
  number (`max_confirm`) of notifications is available in every row (for
  both cumulative and incidence notifications) and the cumulative and
  daily empirical proportion reported are calculated for the user during
  pre-processing (see
  [\#62](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/62) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- The default approach to handling reported notifications beyond the
  maximum delay has been changed. In `0.0.6` and previous versions
  notifications beyond the maximum delay were silently dropped. In
  `0.0.7` this is now optional behaviour (set using `max_delay_strat` in
  [`enw_preprocess_data()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_preprocess_data.md))
  and the default is instead to add these notifications to the last
  included delay were present. This should produce more accurate
  long-term nowcasts when data is available but means that reported
  notifications for the maximum delay need to be interpreted with this
  in mind. See
  [\#62](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/62) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Adds some basic testing and documentation for preprocessing functions.
  See [\#62](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/62) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs).
- Stabilises calculation of expected observations by increasing the
  proportion of the calculation performed on the log scale. This results
  in reduced computation time with the majority of this coming from
  switching to using the `neg_binomial_2_log` family of functions (over
  their natural scale counterparts). See
  [\#65](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/65) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)

## epinowcast 0.0.6

- Simplifies and optimises the internal functions used to estimate the
  parametric daily reporting probability. These are now exposed to the
  user via the `distribution` parameter with both the Lognormal and
  Gamma families being tested to work. Note that both parameterisations
  use their standard parameterisations as given in the stan manual (see
  [\#42](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/42) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs))
- Add profiling switch to model compilation, allowing to toggle
  profiling (<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/profiling.html>)
  on/off in the same model. Also supports .stan files found in
  `include_paths` (see
  [\#41](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/41) and
  [\#54](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/54) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison)).
- Fully vectorise the likelihood by flattening observations and
  pre-specify expected observations into a vector before calculating the
  log-likelihood (see
  [\#40](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/40) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- Adds vectorisation of zero truncated normal distributions (see
  [\#38](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/38) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs))
- `hazard_to_prob` has been optimised using vectorisation (see
  [\#53](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/53) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- `prob_to_hazard` has been optimised so that only required cumulative
  probabilities are calculated (see
  [\#53](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/53) by
  [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison) and
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- Updated to use the `inv_sqrt` stan function (see
  [\#60](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/60) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- Added support for `scoringutils 1.0.0` (see
  [\#61](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/61) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
- Added a basic example helper function,
  [`enw_example()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_example.md),
  to power examples and tests based on work done in
  [`forecast.vocs`](https://epiforecasts.io/forecast.vocs/) (see
  [\#61](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues/61) by
  [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).

## epinowcast 0.0.5

- Convert retrospective data date fields to class of `IDate` when
  utilising `enw_retrospective_data` to solve esoteric error.
- Added full argument name for `include_paths` to avoid console chatter
- Adds a `stanc_options` argument to
  [`enw_model()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_model.md)
  and specifies a new default of `list("01")` which enables simple
  pre-compilation optimisations. See
  [here](https://blog.mc-stan.org/2022/02/15/release-of-cmdstan-2-29/)
  of these optimisation for details.
- Remove `inv_logit` and `logit` as may instead use base R `plogit` and
  `qlogit`.

## epinowcast 0.0.4

- Add support for extracting and summarising posterior nowcast samples
- Package spell check
- Update read me quick start to use 40 days of delay vs 30
- Add a section to the read me quick start showing an example of
  handling nowcast samples.
- Add support for passing custom models and included files to
  [`enw_model()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_model.md).
- Fix a bug where
  [`enw_summarise_samples()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/enw_summarise_samples.md)
  returned duplicate samples.
- Add support for passing holidays as a variable and then adjusting by
  converting the holiday day into a custom day of the week (by default
  Sunday but this is set by the user).
- Added support for scoring on both the natural and log scale. This
  represents absolute and relative scoring respectively.

## epinowcast 0.0.3

- Add support for passing in priors
- Add case study vignette
- Add model definition and implementation details.
- Add support for out of sample scoring (using `scoringutils`).

## epinowcast 0.0.2

- Initial version of the package with broadly working functionality and
  first draft vignettes.

## epinowcast 0.0.1

- Initial package version with development code
