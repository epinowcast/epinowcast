# Construct a convolution matrix

This function allows the construction of convolution matrices which can
be be combined with a vector of primary events to produce a vector of
secondary events for example in the form of a renewal equation or to
simulate reporting delays. Time-varying delays are supported as well as
distribution padding (to allow for use in renewal equation like
approaches).

## Usage

``` r
convolution_matrix(dist, t, include_partial = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- dist:

  A vector of list of vectors describing the distribution to be
  convolved as a probability mass function.

- t:

  Integer value indicating the number of time steps to convolve over.

- include_partial:

  Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, the convolution include partially
  complete secondary events.

## Value

A matrix with each column indicating a primary event and each row
indicating a secondary event.
