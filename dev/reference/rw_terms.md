# Finds random walk terms in a formula object

This function extracts random walk terms denoted using
[`rw()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/rw.md) from a
formula so that they can be processed on their own.

## Usage

``` r
rw_terms(formula)
```

## Arguments

- formula:

  A model formula that may use standard fixed effects, random effects
  using [lme4](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lme4/man/lme4-package.html) syntax
  (see [`re()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/re.md)),
  and random walks defined using the
  [`rw()`](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/rw.md) helper
  function. See the Details section below for a comprehensive
  explanation of the supported syntax.

## Value

A character vector containing the random walk terms that have been
identified in the supplied formula.

## Reference

This function was adapted from code written by J Scott (under an MIT
license) as part of the `epidemia` package
(https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia/).
