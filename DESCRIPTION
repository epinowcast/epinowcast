Description: Tools to enable flexible and efficient hierarchical nowcasting of
    right-truncated epidemiological time-series using a semi-mechanistic
    Bayesian model with support for a range of reporting and generative
    processes. Nowcasting, in this context, is gaining situational awareness
    using currently available observations and the reporting patterns of
    historical observations. This can be useful when tracking the spread of
    infectious disease in real-time: without nowcasting, changes in trends can
    be obfuscated by partial reporting or their detection may be delayed due to
    the use of simpler methods like truncation. While the package has been
    designed with epidemiological applications in mind, it could be applied
    to any set of right-truncated time-series count data.
