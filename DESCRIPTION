Description: A modular Bayesian framework for real-time infectious disease
    surveillance. Provides tools for nowcasting, reproduction number estimation,
    delay estimation, and forecasting from data subject to reporting delays,
    right-truncation, missing data, and incomplete ascertainment. Users can build
    models suited to their setting using a flexible formula interface supporting
    fixed effects, random effects, random walks, and time-varying parameters, with
    options including parametric and non-parametric delay distributions with
    optional modifiers (via discrete-time hazard models), renewal processes,
    observation models, missing data imputation, and stratified analyses with
    partial pooling. By jointly estimating disease dynamics and reporting patterns,
    our framework enables earlier and more reliable detection of trends. While
    designed with epidemiological applications in mind, the framework can be applied
    to any right-truncated time series count data.
