/**
 * Iteratively compute expected latent values using the renewal equation
 * 
 * This function calculates expected latent values over time for different
 * groups using the renewal equation. It's designed to handle scenarios where
 * the generation time is represented either as a constant (leading to
 * exponential growth) or as a vector (requiring a dot product calculation).
 * The function operates on the natural scale for stability and then transforms 
 * the results back to the log scale when the generation time is a vector.
 * 
 * @param lexp_latent_int Matrix of initial log expected latent values.
 *
 * @param r Vector representing growth rate or the log of the effective 
 * reproduction number.
 *
 * @param r_g Array of indices marking the start of each group in the rate
 * vector.
 * @param r_t Number of time periods for rate adjustments.
 *
 * @param r_seed Seed time period for rate-based adjustments.
 *
 * @param gt_n Length of the generation time vector (1 for constant generation
 * time).
 *
 * @param lrgt Log of the generation time vector or scalar.
 *
 * @param t Total number of time periods.
 *
 * @param g Number of groups.
 * 
 * @return An array of vectors containing log-transformed expected latent
 * values for each group and time period.
 * 
 * @note The function performs the following operations:
 *       1. For each group:
 *          a. Extracts a segment of rates specific to the current group.
 *          b. If 'gt_n' is 1 (constant generation time), directly applies a 
 *             cumulative sum on the log scale to model exponential growth.
 *          c. If 'gt_n' > 1 (vector generation time):
 *             i. Converts the log rate and log initial latent values to the 
 *                natural scale.
 *             ii. Uses a dot product with the generation time vector for each 
 *                 time point, following the renewal equation.
 *             iii. Converts the resulting expected values back to the log
 *                  scale, as this approach is expected to be more numerically
 *                  stable than performing the renewal equation directly in log
 *                  space.
