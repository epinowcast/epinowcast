## Summary

```{r, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
cat(gsub("\n[ ]+", " ", packageDescription("epinowcast")$Description))
```

## Installation
  
<details><summary>Installing the package</summary>

```{r, child="vignettes/chunks/_readme-install-epinowcast.Rmd"}
```

*Note: You can also use that last approach to install a specific commit if needed, e.g. if you want to try out a specific unreleased feature, but not the absolute latest developmental version.*

</details>

<details><summary>Installing CmdStan</summary>

If you wish to do model fitting and nowcasting, you will need to install [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan), which also entails having a suitable C++ toolchain setup. We recommend using the [`cmdstanr` package](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). The Stan team provides instructions in the [_Getting started with
`cmdstanr`_](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) vignette, with other details and support at the [package site](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) along with some key instructions available in the [Stan resources package vignette](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/stan-help.html#toolchain), but the brief version is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# if you not yet installed `epinowcast`, or you installed it without `Suggests` dependencies
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
# once `cmdstanr` is installed:
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

*Note: You can speed up CmdStan installation using the `cores` argument. If you are installing a particular version of `epinowcast`, you may also need to install a past version of CmdStan, which you can do with the `version` argument.*

</details>

<details><summary>Alternative: Docker</summary>

We also provide a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) image with [`epinowcast` and all dependencies installed](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/packages/container/package/epinowcast). You can use this image to run `epinowcast` without installing dependencies.

</details>

## Resources

As you use the package, the documentation available via `?enw_` should be your first stop for troubleshooting. We also provide a range of other documentation, case studies, and community spaces to ask (and answer!) questions:

<details><summary>Package Website</summary>

The [`epinowcast` website](https://package.epinowcast.org/) includes a function reference, model outline, and case studies using the package. The site mainly concerns the release version, but you can also find documentation for [the latest development version](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/).

</details>

<details><summary>R Vignettes</summary>

We have created [package vignettes](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles) to help you [get started nowcasting](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/epinowcast.html) and to [highlight other features with case studies](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/germany-age-stratified-nowcasting.html).

</details>

<details><summary>Organisation Website</summary>

Our [organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/) includes links to other resources, [guest posts](https://www.epinowcast.org/blog.html), and [seminar schedule](https://www.epinowcast.org/seminars.html) for both upcoming and past recordings.

</details>

<details><summary>Community Forum</summary>

Our [community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/) has areas for [question and answer](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/interface/15) and [considering new methods and tools](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/projects/11), among others. If you are generally interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease, you may find this useful even if do not use `epinowcast`.

</details>

<details><summary>Package Analysis Scripts</summary>

In addition to the vignettes, the package also comes with [example analyses](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/tree/main/inst/examples). These are not as polished as the vignettes, but we typically explore new features with these and they may help you if you are using a development version. After installing `epinowcast`, you can find them via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files(
  system.file("examples", package = "epinowcast"), full.names = TRUE
)
```

We always like to hear about new use-cases, whether or not they are directed at the core `epinowcast` applications.
