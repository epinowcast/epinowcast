## Summary

_Nowcasting_ is predicting the *current* situation, addressing the practical reality that the data we want *now* will not be available until *later*. The `{epinowcast}` package provides you tools for nowcasting epidemiological data in a convenient, flexible, and efficient collection of `R` functions. Those functions implement a model of infectious disease spread and reporting using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian approach with a range of reporting and generative processes. Using this approach, you will typically see changes in trends earlier and more reliably than if using methods like truncation.

*Note: while we designed `epinowcast` with epidemiological applications in mind, and that is reflected in its core model, you could use it to apply your own model to other right-truncated time-series count data.*

## Installation
  
<details><summary>Installing the package</summary>

You can install the latest released version using the normal `R` function, though you need to point to `r-universe` instead of CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev"
)
```

Alternatively, you can use the [`remotes` package](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) to install the development version from Github (warning! this version may contain breaking changes and/or bugs):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE
)
```

Similarly, you can install historical versions by specifying the release tag (e.g. this installs [`0.2.0`](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.2.0)):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE, ref = "v0.2.0"
)
```

*Note: You can also use that last approach to install a specific commit if needed, e.g. if you want to try out a specific unreleased feature, but not the absolute latest developmental version.*

<details><summary>Installing CmdStan</summary>

If you wish to do model fitting and nowcasting, you will need to install [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan), which also entails having a suitable C++ toolchain setup. We recommend using the [`cmdstanr` package](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). The Stan team provides instructions in the [_Getting started with
`cmdstanr`_](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) vignette, with other details and support at the [package site](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), but the brief version is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# if you not yet installed `epinowcast`, or you installed it without `Suggests` dependencies
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
# once `cmdstanr` is installed:
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

*Note: You can speed up CmdStan installation using the `cores` argument. If you are installing a particular version of `epinowcast`, you may also need to install a past version of CmdStan, which you can do with the `version` argument.*

</details>

<details><summary>Alternative: Docker</summary>

We also provide a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) image with [`epinowcast` and all dependencies installed](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/packages/container/package/epinowcast). You can use this image to run `epinowcast` without installing dependencies.

</details>

## Resources

As you use the package, the documentation available via `?enw_` should be your first stop for troubleshooting. We also provide a range of other documentation, case studies, and community spaces to ask (and answer!) questions:

<details><summary>Package Website</summary>

The [`epinowcast` website](https://package.epinowcast.org/) includes a function reference, model outline, and case studies using the package. The site mainly concerns the release version, but you can also find documentation for [the latest development version](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/).

</details>

<details><summary>R Vignettes</summary>

We have created [package vignettes](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles) to help you [get started nowcasting](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/epinowcast.html) and to [highlight other features with case studies](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/germany-age-stratified-nowcasting.html).

</details>

<details><summary>Organisation Website</summary>

Our [organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/) includes links to other resources, [guest posts](https://www.epinowcast.org/blog.html), and [seminar schedule](https://www.epinowcast.org/seminars.html) for both upcoming and past recordings.

</details>

<details><summary>Community Forum</summary>

Our [community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/) has areas for [question and answer](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/interface/15) and [considering new methods and tools](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/projects/11), among others. If you are generally interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease, you may find this useful even if do not use `epinowcast`.

</details>

<details><summary>Package Analysis Scripts</summary>

In addition to the vignettes, the package also comes with [example analyses](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/tree/main/inst/examples). These are not as polished as the vignettes, but we typically explore new features with these and they may help you if you are using a development version. After installing `epinowcast`, you can find them via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files(
  system.file("examples", package = "epinowcast"), full.names = TRUE
)
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and new contributors! We particularly appreciate help on [identifying and identified issues](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues). Please check and add to the issues, and/or add a [pull request](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/pulls) and see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

If you need a different underlying model for you work: `epinowcast` lets you pass your own models! If you do try new model parameterisations that expand the overall flexibility or improve the defaults, please let us know either here or on the [community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/). We always like to hear about new use-cases, whether or not they are directed at the core `epinowcast` applications.

### How to make a bug report or feature request

Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect in an [issue](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues). If you have a question, please don't open an issue. Instead, ask on our [Q and A page](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/discussions/categories/q-a). See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
