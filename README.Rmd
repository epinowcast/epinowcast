Tools to enable flexible and efficient hierarchical nowcasting of right-truncated epidemiological time-series using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian model with support for a range of reporting and generative processes. Nowcasting, in this context, is gaining situational awareness using currently available observations and the reporting patterns of historical observations. This can be useful when tracking the spread of infectious disease in real-time: without nowcasting, changes in trends can be obfuscated by partial reporting or their detection may be delayed due to the use of simpler methods like truncation. While the package has been designed with epidemiological applications in mind, it could be applied to any set of right-truncated time-series count data.

## Getting started and learning more

This README is a good place to get started with `epinowcast`, in particular the following installation and quick start sections. As you make use of the package, or if your problem requires a richer feature set than presented here, we also provide a range of other documentation, case studies, and spaces for the community to interact with each other. Below is a short list of current resources.
- [Package website](https://package.epinowcast.org/): This includes a function reference, model outline, and case studies making use of the package. This site refers to the release version of our package which can be installed from our Universe or from the latest GitHub release (see installation instructions). The development version of our documentation (corresponding to our `main` branch on GitHub) is available [here](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/).
- [Organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/): This includes links to our other resources as well as guest posts from community members and schedules for any related seminars being run by community members.
- [Directory of example scripts](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/tree/main/inst/examples): Not as fleshed out as our complete case studies these scripts are used during package developemnt and each showcase a subset of package functionality. Often newly introduced features will be explored here before surfacing in other areas of our documentation.
- [Community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/): Our community forum is where development of methods and tools is discussed, along with related research from our members and discussions between users. If you are interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease this is likely a good place to start regardless of if you end up making use of `epinowcast`.

## Installation

### Installing the package

Install the latest released version of the package with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev")
```

Alternatively, install the development version (whilst we strive to limit breaking changes or the introduction of bugs during development this version may contain both) from GitHub using the following,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Historical package releases can be installed from GitHub using `remotes` by adding the release tag as in the following example (which installs [`0.2.0`](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.2.0)),
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast@v0.2.0", dependencies = TRUE)
```

*Note: A similar method can be used to install a particular commit of the package which may be useful for some users who are unable to use a fixed release but concerned about the stability of their dependencies.*

### Installing CmdStan

If you don't already have CmdStan installed then, in addition to installing `epinowcast`, it is also necessary to install CmdStan using CmdStanR's 
`install_cmdstan()` function to enable model fitting in `epinowcast`. A suitable C++ toolchain is also required. Instructions are provided in the [_Getting started with
CmdStanR_](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) vignette. See the [CmdStanR documentation](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for further details and support. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

*Note: This install process can be sped up using the `cores` argument and past versions can be installed using the `version` argument (which may be useful if install historical package releases).*

### Docker 

As an alternative to local installation we provide a Docker image with `epinowcast` and all dependencies installed. This can be used to run `epinowcast` without installing dependencies locally. The image is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/packages/container/package/epinowcast).

## Quick start

In this quick start we use COVID-19 hospitalisations by date of positive test in Germany available up to the 1st of October 2021 to demonstrate the specification and fitting of a simple nowcasting model using `epinowcast`. Examples using more complex models are available in the package vignettes and in the papers linked to in the literature vignette.

### Package

As well as `epinowcast` this quick start makes use of `data.table` and `ggplot2` which are both installed when `epinowcast` is installed.

```{r}
library(epinowcast)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Data

Nowcasting is effectively the estimation of reporting patterns for recently reported data. This requires data on these patterns for previous observations and typically this means the time series of data as reported on multiple consecutive days (in theory non-consecutive days could be used but this is not yet supported in `epinowcast`). For this quick start these data are sourced from the [Robert Koch Institute via the Germany Nowcasting hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/wiki/Truth-data#role-an-definition-of-the-seven-day-hospitalization-incidence) where they are deconvolved from weekly data and days with negative reported hospitalisations are adjusted. 

Below we first filter for a snapshot of retrospective data available 40 days before the 1st of October that contains 40 days of data and then produce the nowcast target based on the latest available hospitalisations by date of positive test.

```{r}
nat_germany_hosp <-
  germany_covid19_hosp[location == "DE"][age_group %in% "00+"] |>
  enw_filter_report_dates(latest_date = "2021-10-01")

retro_nat_germany <- nat_germany_hosp |>
  enw_filter_report_dates(remove_days = 40) |>
  enw_filter_reference_dates(include_days = 40)
retro_nat_germany
```

```{r}
latest_germany_hosp <- nat_germany_hosp |>
  enw_latest_data() |>
  enw_filter_reference_dates(remove_days = 40, include_days = 40)
head(latest_germany_hosp, n = 10)
```

### Data preprocessing and model specification

Process reported data into format required for `epinowcast` and return in a `data.table`. At this stage specify grouping (i.e age, location) if any. It can be useful to check this output before beginning to model to make sure everything is as expected.

```{r}
pobs <- enw_preprocess_data(retro_nat_germany, max_delay = 40)
pobs
```

Construct a parametric lognormal intercept only model for the date of reference using the metadata produced by `enw_preprocess_data()`. Note that `epinowcast` uses a sparse design matrix for parametric delay distributions to reduce runtimes so the design matrix shows only unique rows with `index` containing the mapping to the full design matrix.

```{r}
reference_module <- enw_reference(~1, distribution = "lognormal", data = pobs)
```

Construct a model with a random effect for the day of report using the metadata produced by `enw_preprocess_data()`.

```{r}
report_module <- enw_report(~ (1 | day_of_week), data = pobs)
```

Construct a model with a lognormal random walk on expected cases. See `enw_expectation()` for other suggested choices.

```{r}
expectation_module <- enw_expectation(
  ~ 0 + (1 | day), data = pobs
)
```

### Model fitting

First compile the model. This step can be left to `epinowcast` but here we want to use multiple cores per chain to speed up model fitting and so need to compile the model with this feature turned on.

```{r}
model <- enw_model(threads = TRUE)
```

We now fit the model and produce a nowcast using this fit. Note that here we use two chains each using two threads as a demonstration but in general using 4 chains is recommended. Also note that warm-up and sampling iterations have been set below default values to reduce compute requirements but this may not be sufficient for many real world use cases. Finally, note that here we have silenced fitting progress and potential warning messages for the purposes of keeping this quick start short but in general this should not be done.

```{r}
options(mc.cores = 2)
nowcast <- epinowcast(pobs,
  expectation = expectation_module,
  reference = reference_module,
  report = report_module,
  fit = enw_fit_opts(,
    save_warmup = FALSE, pp = TRUE,
    chains = 2, threads_per_chain = 2,
    iter_sampling = 500, iter_warmup = 500,
    show_messages = FALSE, refresh = 0
  ),
  model = model
)
```

### Results

Print the output from `epinowcast` which includes diagnostic information, the data used for fitting, and the `cmdstanr` object.

```{r}
nowcast
```

Summarise the nowcast for the latest snapshot of data.

```{r}
nowcast |>
  summary(probs = c(0.05, 0.95)) |>
  head(n = 10)
```

Plot the summarised nowcast against currently observed data (or optionally more recent data for comparison purposes).

```{r nowcast}
plot(nowcast, latest_obs = latest_germany_hosp)
```

Plot posterior predictions for observed notifications by date of
report as a check of how well the model reproduces the observed data.

```{r pp, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 16, message = FALSE}
plot(nowcast, type = "posterior") +
  facet_wrap(vars(reference_date), scale = "free")
```

Rather than using the methods supplied for `epinowcast` directly, package functions can also be used to extract nowcast posterior samples, summarise them, and then plot them. This is demonstrated here by plotting the 7 day incidence for hospitalisations.

```{r week_nowcast}
# extract samples
samples <- summary(nowcast, type = "nowcast_samples")

# Take a 7 day rolling sum of both samples and observations
cols <- c("confirm", "sample")
samples[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, frollsum, n = 7),
  .SDcols = cols, by = ".draw"
][!is.na(sample)]
latest_germany_hosp_7day <- copy(latest_germany_hosp)[
  ,
  confirm := frollsum(confirm, n = 7)
][!is.na(confirm)]

# Summarise samples
sum_across_last_7_days <- enw_summarise_samples(samples)

# Plot samples
enw_plot_nowcast_quantiles(sum_across_last_7_days, latest_germany_hosp_7day)
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and new contributors! We particularly appreciate help on priority problems in the [issues](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues). Please check and add to the issues, and/or add a [pull request](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/pulls). See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

If interested in expanding the functionality of the underlying model note that `epinowcast` allows users to pass in their own models meaning that alternative parameterisations, for example altering the forecast model used for inferring expected observations, may be easily tested within the package infrastructure. Once this testing has been done alterations that increase the flexibility of the package model and improves its defaults are very welcome via pull request or other communication with the package authors. Even if not wanting to add your updated model to the package please do reach out as we would love to hear about your use case.
