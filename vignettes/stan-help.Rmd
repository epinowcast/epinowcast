## Epinowcast and Stan

[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is the probabilistic programming language and statistical platform for statistical modelling that powers the Bayesian inference in `epinowcast`.
The statistical models used in `epinowcast` are primarily written in the [Stan programming language](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html), a statically typed programming language with syntax similar to C/C++.
`epinowcast` utilises the [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) package to inferface with CmdStan, the program which excutes the models written in the Stan programming language.
It is important to understand that CmdStan is a program that is **distinct** from but interfaced through R.
As describe in the `epinowcast` project [README](./index.html), you will need to install [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/)  R package which also has the ability to install CmdStan using an R interface. 
Additionally, you will need to make sure that the software required by CmdStan is installed and configured on your machine.

### Ensuring you have the proper toolchain {.toolchain}

The Stan code that is written in the `epinowcast` package converted[^1] to optimised C++ code and then compiled to machine readable instructions.
Because Stan needs a several programs to execute this compilation process such as the build tool [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) and a C++ compiler, you will need to ensure that your system has the appropriate supporting software, known as a toolchain.
The steps to install this additional software are in addition to R and are **platform specific**.
As a reminder, these installation steps occur **outside of R**.
The Stan team has assembled very detailed instructions for each platform:

* [**Windows**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#windows)
* [**MacOS**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#macos)
* [**Linux**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#linux)


After completing your platform specific toolshain installation, you can move on to R.


### Now install CmdStanR and CmdStan

Now you can open a session of R using your favourite IDE like Vscode or RStudio.
You'll need to install the CmdStanR package, the R package which allows you to interface with CmdStan through R code.
There is a [very detailed installation guide available for CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) which provides the authorative installation instructions.

Install the CmdStanR package using the below code.

```r
# In a fresh R session run the following in your R console.
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

```

To ensure that your toolchain instllation occured sucessfully, run the following code in your R terminal:

```r
check_cmdstan_toolchain()
```

This function will report back if the toolchain is available and set-up as follows:

```r
#> The C++ toolchain required for CmdStan is setup properly!
```

If you do not get this message, return to [the installation instuctions](#toolchain) and ensure that all steps were followed.

Assuming you have the the toolchain installed, you can install CmdStanR.

```r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = 2)
```

## Epinowcast modeling

### Installation

As described in the project README, you can install the `epinowcast` package within R.

```r
# Stable version from:
install.packages("epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev")

# Development version from:
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Running your first model

The first time you fit a model with `epinowcast` will be **slow**!
This is normal as all of the Stan code is being compiled for the first time.
Note that the compiled Stan binaries will live in your user package directory (or wherever you have defined your package libraries).
Because of this package architecture

- Each time you install a new version of `epinowcast` you will experience this longer compilation time the first time you fit a model.
- If you upgrade your version of CmdStan, you will likely need to recompile your models. This may occur automatically, or necessitate re-installing `epinowcast`.


## Other resources

The Stan community is a pretty warm and opening place and receptive to helping others.

[^1]: The Stan code is actually first passed to a Stan specific compiled written in Ocaml called [stanc3](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3).
The optimised C++ code generated from this first step is then passed to the C++ compiler.
