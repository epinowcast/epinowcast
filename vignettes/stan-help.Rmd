# Epinowcast and Stan

[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is the probabilistic programming language and statistical platform for statistical modelling that powers the Bayesian inference in `{epinowcast}`.
The statistical models used in `{epinowcast}` are primarily written in the [Stan programming language](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html), a statically typed programming language with syntax similar to C/C++.
`{epinowcast}` utilises the [`{cmdstanr}`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) package to inferface with CmdStan, the program which excutes the models written in the Stan programming language.
It is important to understand that CmdStan is a program that is **distinct** from but interfaced through R.
As describe in the `"{epinowcast}"` project [README](./index.html), you will need to install [`{cmdstanr}`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/)  R package which also has the ability to install CmdStan using an R interface. 
Additionally, you will need to make sure that the software required by CmdStan is installed and configured on your machine.

## Ensuring you have the proper toolchain {.toolchain}

The Stan code that is written in the `{epinowcast}` package converted[^1] to optimised C++ code and then compiled to machine readable instructions.
Because Stan needs a several programs to execute this compilation process such as the build tool [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) and a C++ compiler, you will need to ensure that your system has the appropriate supporting software, known as a toolchain.
The steps to install this additional software are in addition to R and are **platform specific**.
As a reminder, these installation steps occur **outside of R**.
The Stan team has assembled very detailed instructions for each platform:

* [**Windows**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#windows)
* [**MacOS**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#macos)
* [**Linux**](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html#linux)


After completing your platform specific toolshain installation, you can move on to R.


## Now install CmdStanR and CmdStan

Now you can open a session of R using your favourite IDE like Vscode or RStudio.
You'll need to install the CmdStanR package, the R package which allows you to interface with CmdStan through R code.
There is a [very detailed installation guide available for CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) which provides the authorative installation instructions.

Install the CmdStanR package using the below code.

```r
# In a fresh R session run the following in your R console.
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

```

To ensure that your toolchain instllation occured sucessfully, run the following code in your R terminal:

```r
check_cmdstan_toolchain()
```

This function will report back if the toolchain is available and set-up as follows:

```r
#> The C++ toolchain required for CmdStan is setup properly!
```

If you do not get this message, return to [the installation instuctions](#toolchain) and ensure that all steps were followed.

Assuming you have the the toolchain installed, you can install CmdStanR.

```r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = 2)
```

# Epinowcast modeling

## Installation

As described in the project README, you can install the `"{epinowcast}"` package within R.

```r
# Stable version from:
install.packages("epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev")

# Development version from:
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Running your first model

The first time you fit a model with `{epinowcast}` will be **slow**!
This is normal as all of the Stan code is being compiled for the first time.
Note that the compiled Stan binaries will live in your user package directory (or wherever you have defined your package libraries).
Because of this package architecture

- Each time you install a new version of `{epinowcast}` you will experience this longer compilation time the first time you fit a model.
- If you upgrade your version of CmdStan, you will likely need to recompile your models. This may occur automatically, or necessitate re-installing `{epinowcast}`.


## Setting `enw_fit_opts`

The `enw_fit_opts` allows you to set several critical components for the Stan computational engine.
These parameters are passed to Stan during the model fitting process and have an influence on computation time and quality of the model fit.
Knowing when and if the defaults need to be changed is an important part of the Bayesian workflow.[@gelmanBayesianWorkflow2020]
All of the parameters are passed to the `sampling` function available from [`{cmdstanr}`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/model-method-sample.html).


# Failures modes

In this section we will discuss the most common issues when working with `{epinowcast}` specifically and CmdStan/ Bayesian inference more generally.
The solutions to these issues typically require you to investigate your [sampler settings](#samplerParams), [model settings](#modelParams), or [interogate your data](#modelData) further.

## Sampler settings {.samplerParams}

`{epinowcast}` provides users the ability to pass arguments directly to CmdStan which can improve model run time and produce better inferences.
These parameters can be passed the `enw_fit_opts` function.

### `threads_per_chain` and `chains`

One of the key components of Bayesian inference is creating draws from independent Markov chains.
To assess convergence and the reliability of a given posterior distribution it is vital that at least two chains are used with **`4` chains** being the more common default.

Stan allows for multi-threading and the Stan code used within `{epinowcast}` has tried to take advantage of these capabilities where possible.
Multi-theading allows for the calculations to be spread across multiple threads, which could accelerate inference by allowing embarassingly parallel calculations to be spread across threads and then later combined.
If possible, a good default is `2`, however, if you have available compute on your machine, you can increase this to a higher value and may see some fit time reductions.

::: {.alert .alert-warning}
**The product of the `thread_per_chain` and `chains`** arguments should be equal to or less than the number of cores on your machine! 
:::





### iter_warmup and iter_sampling

The number of samples using for the warmup phase of Stan and the number of sampling iterations are controlled by the `iter_warmup` and `iter_sampling` arguments, respectively.
Stan requires a sufficient number of warmup iterations to dynamically estimate the step change sizes during model fitting. 
Unlike with Gibbs sampling (such as the method used in JAGS), you do not need to set large values for `iter_warmup` or `iter_sampling`.
Conversely, setting large values for iterations is a sign of poor model fit and indicates that other approaches need to be employed (e.g., `priors`, `adapt_delta`, `max_treedepth`)
Typically, 1000-2000 samples for `iter_warmup` and `iter_sampling` are sufficient.


### max_treedepth

This value controls the size of the trajectory taken by the sample (in power of 2) take for each step.
If this value is too low, the sampler may terminate too early causing excess runtimes.
You can increase the `max_treedepth` to an integer value greater than `10` up to `15` (or lower).
Given the complexity of the models used in `{epinowcast}` it is common to have the `max_treedepth` set between 12 and 15.

### adapt_delta

This parameter sets the target average proposal acceptable probability during NUTS sampling (and is a real number values between 0 and 1).
Higher values of `adapt_delta` will result in smaller step sizes during sampling which will slow the model fitting time but can help to address *divergent transitions.*
The default value is 0.8, but it is likely that this will need to be set slightly higher like 0.9 to 0.99 given the complexity of the models being fit.

### Some decent defaults

For a computer with 8 cores, a reasonable configuration would be the following:

```r
enw_fit_opts(
    save_warmup = FALSE,
    pp = TRUE,
    chains = 4,
    threads_per_chain = 2,
    adapt_delta = 0.95,
    max_treedepth = 12,
    iter_sampling = 2000,
    iter_warmup = 1000,
    show_messages = FALSE
)

```

### Setting priors {.settingPriors}




## Exploring your data {.modelData}


## Common failure modes

### My model takes too long to run

One of the more common issues with Bayesian inference is that the sampler may take a long time to run.
This can occur because the sampler is having difficulty exploring the posterior parameter space given the model and your data.


1. Ensure that your priors are as informative as possible. The priors for your model can be seen using the [nw_reference](`https://package.epinowcast.org/reference/enw_reference.html`)

### My `r_hat`s are high and by `ess`s are low


### The posterior estimates are very wide
