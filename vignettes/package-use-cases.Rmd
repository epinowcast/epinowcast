The goal of this is to provide a place to document how `{epinowcast}` has been applied in real-world settings. To start, we will document a few known use cases, many of which the authors are directly involved in. We hope this can both inspire future users to apply the methods to similar use cases of their own, and those currently or previously using `{epinowcast}` to document it here. This should also motivate and help prioritize future development.

The table below contains columns to provide information on the following variables related to the use case:
`Pathogen`: Pathogen of interest in the use case, e.g. COVID-19.
`Data type(s)`: A brief description of the data source(s) used e.g. individual level line-list clinical case data
`Purpose`: Brief description of the purpose of using `{epinowcast}` e.g. research or real-time response
`Location`: Specific geographic location and associated granularity of the data to e.g. counties in the United States
`Organization affiliation`: Type of organization doing the analysis e.g. academic, federal government, local health department
`Links`: Include here any links to manuscripts/pre-prints and github repositories describing and applying the analysis, e.g. [Manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012021#sec014)
