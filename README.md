Tools to enable flexible and efficient hierarchical nowcasting of
right-truncated epidemiological time-series using a semi-mechanistic
Bayesian model with support for a range of reporting and generative
processes. Nowcasting, in this context, is gaining situational awareness
using currently available observations and the reporting patterns of
historical observations. This can be useful when tracking the spread of
infectious disease in real-time: without nowcasting, changes in trends
can be obfuscated by partial reporting or their detection may be delayed
due to the use of simpler methods like truncation. While the package has
been designed with epidemiological applications in mind, it could be
applied to any set of right-truncated time-series count data.

## Getting started and learning more

This README is a good place to get started with `epinowcast`, in
particular the following installation and quick start sections. As you
make use of the package, or if your problem requires a richer feature
set than presented here, we also provide a range of other documentation,
case studies, and spaces for the community to interact with each other.
Below is a short list of current resources.

- [Package website](https://package.epinowcast.org/): This includes a
  function reference, model outline, and case studies making use of the
  package. This site refers to the release version of our package which
  can be installed from our Universe or from the latest GitHub release
  (see installation instructions). The development version of our
  documentation (corresponding to our `main` branch on GitHub) is
  available [here](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/).

- [Organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/): This includes
  links to our other resources as well as guest posts from community
  members and schedules for any related seminars being run by community
  members.

- [Directory of example
  scripts](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/tree/main/inst/examples):
  Not as fleshed out as our complete case studies these scripts are used
  during package development and each showcase a subset of package
  functionality. Often newly introduced features will be explored here
  before surfacing in other areas of our documentation.

- [Community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/): Our community
  forum is where development of methods and tools is discussed, along
  with related research from our members and discussions between users.
  If you are interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease this
  is likely a good place to start regardless of if you end up making use
  of `epinowcast`.

## Installation

### Installing the package

Install the latest released version of the package with:

``` r
install.packages("epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev")
```

Alternatively, install the development version (whilst we strive to
limit breaking changes or the introduction of bugs during development
this version may contain both) from GitHub using the following,

``` r
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Historical package releases can be installed from GitHub using `remotes`
by adding the release tag as in the following example (which installs
[`0.2.0`](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/releases/tag/v0.2.0)),

``` r
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE, ref = "v0.2.0")
```

*Note: A similar method can be used to install a particular commit of
the package which may be useful for some users who are unable to use a
fixed release but concerned about the stability of their dependencies.*

### Installing CmdStan

If you don’t already have CmdStan installed then, in addition to
installing `epinowcast`, it is also necessary to install CmdStan using
`cmdstanr`’s `install_cmdstan()` function to enable model fitting in
`epinowcast`. A suitable C++ toolchain is also required. Instructions
are provided in the [*Getting started with
`cmdstanr`*](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html)
vignette. See the [`cmdstanr`
documentation](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for further details and
support.

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

*Note: This install process can be sped up using the `cores` argument
and past versions can be installed using the `version` argument (which
may be useful if install historical package releases).*

### Docker

As an alternative to local installation we provide a Docker image with
`epinowcast` and all dependencies installed. This can be used to run
`epinowcast` without installing dependencies locally. The image is
available
[here](https://github.com/orgs/epinowcast/packages/container/package/epinowcast).

## Quick start

In this quick start, we use the example of COVID-19 hospitalisations in
Germany to demonstrate the specification and fitting of a simple
nowcasting model using `epinowcast`. Examples using more complex models
are available in the package vignettes and in the papers referenced in
the literature vignette.

### Package

In addition to `epinowcast`, this quick start makes use of `data.table`
and `ggplot2`, which are both installed when `epinowcast` is installed.

``` r
library(epinowcast)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Data

Nowcasting of right-truncated case counts involves the estimation of
reporting delays for recently reported data. For this, we need to count
cases both by when they occurred (often called “reference date”) and by
when they were reported (often called “report date”). Then, the
difference between the reference date and the report date is the
reporting delay. For this quick start, we use data sourced from the
[Robert Koch Institute via the Germany Nowcasting
hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/wiki/Truth-data#role-an-definition-of-the-seven-day-hospitalization-incidence).
The data represent hospitalisation counts by date of positive test and
date of test report in Germany up to October 1, 2021.

We first filter for a snapshot of retrospective data available 40 days
before October 1, 2021 that contains 40 days of data. Then, we create
the nowcast target which is the latest available hospitalisations by
date of positive test. This will allow us to visualise how our nowcast
made at the time compares to what was ultimately reported.

``` r
nat_germany_hosp <-
  germany_covid19_hosp[location == "DE"][age_group %in% "00+"] |>
  enw_filter_report_dates(latest_date = "2021-10-01")

retro_nat_germany <- nat_germany_hosp |>
  enw_filter_report_dates(remove_days = 40) |>
  enw_filter_reference_dates(include_days = 40)
retro_nat_germany
#>      reference_date location age_group confirm report_date
#>   1:     2021-07-13       DE       00+      21  2021-07-13
#>   2:     2021-07-14       DE       00+      22  2021-07-14

```

This data is already in a format that can be used with `epinowcast`, as
it contains

- a reference date (column `reference_date`): the date of the
  observation, in this example the date of a positive test
- a report date (column `report_date`): the date of report for a given
  set of observations by reference date
- a count (column `confirm`): the total (i.e. cumulative) number of
  hospitalisations by reference date and report date.

The package also provides a range of tools to convert data from line
list, incidence, or other common formats into the required format (see
[Data
converters](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/index.html#data-converters)).

``` r
latest_germany_hosp <- nat_germany_hosp |>
  enw_latest_data() |>
  enw_filter_reference_dates(remove_days = 40, include_days = 40)
head(latest_germany_hosp, n = 10)
#>     reference_date location age_group confirm report_date
#>  1:     2021-07-13       DE       00+      60  2021-10-01
#>  2:     2021-07-14       DE       00+      74  2021-10-01
#>  3:     2021-07-15       DE       00+      69  2021-10-01
#>  4:     2021-07-16       DE       00+      49  2021-10-01
#>  5:     2021-07-17       DE       00+      67  2021-10-01

#> 10:     2021-07-22       DE       00+      99  2021-10-01
```

### Data preprocessing

Before modelling, the input data needs to be converted into the
“reporting triangle” format (see [our model description for
details](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/model)). We also need
to determine metadata to facilitate the model specification. This
includes the number of days of data to use for the reference and report
modules, the maximum delay to consider, and, optionally, a grouping
(i.e. age group, location, or both) of observations. We process reported
data into the format required for `epinowcast` and return it in a
`data.table`. At this stage, we need to specify a grouping (i.e age,
location) if any.

``` r
pobs <- enw_preprocess_data(retro_nat_germany, max_delay = 40)
pobs
#>                    obs          new_confirm              latest
#> 1: <data.table[860x9]> <data.table[860x11]> <data.table[41x10]>
#>    missing_reference  reporting_triangle      metareference          metareport
#> 1: <data.table[0x6]> <data.table[41x42]> <data.table[41x9]> <data.table[80x12]>
#>             metadelay time snapshots by groups max_delay   max_date
#> 1: <data.table[40x4]>   41        41         1        40 2021-08-22
```

The returned output is in the form of a `data.table` with metadata
stored as variables. It can be useful to check this output before
specifying the model, just to make sure everything is as expected.

### Model specification

The `epinowcast` package is designed to provide users with a flexible
and customizable modelling framework. The package comes equipped with
several modules that users can utilize to construct models, and also
allows users to create their own modules. These ensures that models can
be tailored to the user’s specific data and context.

#### Default nowcasting model

The default nowcasting model in `epinowcast` consists of three modules:

- A process (expectation) module that models the expected counts by date
  of reference (`reference_date`)
- A parametric reference reporting model which models the reporting
  delay distribution from the date of reference
- A non-parametric reporting model which models differences in the
  reporting delay distribution by date of report (`report_date`), for
  example, day-of-the-week effects on the reporting delay.

In the following sections, we specify simple models for each of these
modules. The appropriateness of these specifications will vary depending
on your context. See our vignettes for further details on model
specification and examples of more complex models.

#### Process model

A commonly used process model in nowcasting is to model the expected
counts by date of reference via a geometric random walk as this acts as
a minimally informed smoothing prior and thus gives a lot of weight to
the observed data. This is the default process model in `epinowcast`.
Users may also specify this model for themselves using the
enw_expectation() function.

``` r
expectation_module <- enw_expectation(
  ~ 0 + (1 | day), data = pobs
)
```

Here, `day` refers to the number of days from the start of the data.

As the underlying process model is an exponential growth rate model
($C_t = C_{t-1} \exp^{r_t}$), specifying a random effect
(i.e. `(1 | day)`) on the growth rate is equivalent to a geometric
random walk on expected counts by reference date. We are defining a
random effect as,

$$ \text{day} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma) $$

$$ \sigma \sim \text{Half-Normal}(0, 1).$$

#### Reporting model by reference date

Our baseline assumption for the reporting delay is that it is
log-normally distributed, and static over time and strata. We can
specify this model using the `enw_reference()` function,

``` r
reference_module <- enw_reference(~1, distribution = "lognormal", data = pobs)
```

Note that the default distribution is log-normal, hence the distribution
argument could be omitted here.

#### Reporting effects by report date

Even where there is evidence that reporting processes can be
approximated by a single distribution, there may be additional reporting
effects that are not captured by the reference model. For example,
reporting may be lower on weekends or holidays. We can specify a model
for these effects using a hazard formulation (which captures the
conditional relationship between different reporting delays, see [our
model description for
details](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/model)) using the
`enw_report()` function. Here we specify a model with a random effect
for the day of the week to capture weekly seasonality in the reporting
delay.

``` r
report_module <- enw_report(~ (1 | day_of_week), data = pobs)
```

### Precompiling the model

As `epinowcast` uses `cmdstan` to fit its models, it is necessary to
first compile the model. This can be done using the `enw_model()`
function. Note that this step can be left to `epinowcast`, but here we
want to use multiple cores per chain to speed up model fitting and
therefore compile the model with this feature turned on.

``` r
model <- enw_model(threads = TRUE)
```

### Bringing it all together: Fitting the model

We can now fit the model using the [“No-U-Turn Sampler Markov chain
Monte Carlo”
method](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/hamiltonian-monte-carlo.html).
This is a type of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and is the
core fitting method used by `cmdstan`. The NUTS MCMC method is
efficient, automatically tunes its own parameters and is robust to
correlations between parameters, making it fast and effective at
generating samples from the posterior distribution. We specify fitting
options using `enw_fit_opts()` (note that the settings shown here are
tuned for speed and may not be appropriate for many real world use
cases). We also pass our preprocessed data (`pobs`), our pre-compiled
model (`model`), and our model modules (`expectation_module`,
`reference_module`, and `report_module`) to `epinowcast`, where they are
combined and used to fit the model.

``` r
options(mc.cores = 2)
nowcast <- epinowcast(data = pobs,
  expectation = expectation_module,
  reference = reference_module,
  report = report_module,
  fit = enw_fit_opts(
    save_warmup = FALSE, pp = TRUE,
    chains = 2, threads_per_chain = 2,
    iter_sampling = 500, iter_warmup = 500,
    show_messages = FALSE
  ),
  model = model
)
```

### The `epinowcast` object

The `epinowcast()` function returns an `epinowcast` object which
includes diagnostic information, the data used for fitting, and the
underlying [`CmdStanModel`
object](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/CmdStanModel.html).

``` r
nowcast
#>                    obs          new_confirm              latest
#> 1: <data.table[860x9]> <data.table[860x11]> <data.table[41x10]>

#> 1:                 291                0.291     99.2
```

### Summarising and plotting the nowcast

The nowcast (the combination of currently observed and predicted
unobserved data) can then be summarised using

``` r
nowcast |>
  summary(probs = c(0.05, 0.95)) |>
  head(n = 10)
#>     reference_date report_date .group max_confirm location age_group confirm

Similarly, the summarised nowcast can be plotted against the latest
observed data using

``` r
plot(nowcast, latest_obs = latest_germany_hosp)
```

### Plotting posterior predictions

Plotting posterior predictions can be a useful way of assessing
performance and checking that the model is capturing the underlying data
generation process adequately. We can do this directly on the output of
`epinowcast()` using

``` r
plot(nowcast, type = "posterior") +
  facet_wrap(vars(reference_date), scale = "free")
```

### Using package functions rather than S3 methods

Rather than using S3 methods supplied for `epinowcast()` directly,
package functions can also be used to extract nowcast posterior samples,
summarise them, and then plot them. This is demonstrated here by
plotting the 7 day incidence for hospitalisations.

``` r
# extract samples
samples <- summary(nowcast, type = "nowcast_samples")

# Take a 7 day rolling sum of both samples and observations
cols <- c("confirm", "sample")
samples[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, frollsum, n = 7),
  .SDcols = cols, by = ".draw"
][!is.na(sample)]

Here we see that the model is underestimating the incidence of
hospitalisations that were ultimately reported. There are a range of
potential reasons for this, the first being that the process model does
not fully capture the trend or day of the week periodicity present in
the data. See our case study vignettes for ideas on how deal with such
issues.

If interested in expanding the functionality of the underlying model
note that `epinowcast` allows users to pass in their own models meaning
that alternative parameterisations, for example altering the forecast
model used for inferring expected observations, may be easily tested
within the package infrastructure. Once this testing has been done
alterations that increase the flexibility of the package model and
improves its defaults are very welcome via pull request or other
communication with the package authors. Even if not wanting to add your
updated model to the package please do reach out as we would love to
hear about your use case.
