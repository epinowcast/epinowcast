Tools to enable flexible and efficient hierarchical nowcasting of
right-truncated epidemiological time-series using a semi-mechanistic
Bayesian model with support for a range of reporting and generative
processes. Nowcasting, in this context, is gaining situational awareness
using currently available observations and the reporting patterns of
historical observations. This can be useful when tracking the spread of
infectious disease in real-time: without nowcasting, changes in trends
can be obfuscated by partial reporting or their detection may be delayed
due to the use of simpler methods like truncation. While the package has
been designed with epidemiological applications in mind, it could be
applied to any set of right-truncated time-series count data.

## Getting started and learning more

This README is a good place to get started with `epinowcast`, in
particular the following installation and quick start sections. As you
make use of the package, or if your problem requires a richer feature
set than presented here, we also provide a range of other documentation,
case studies, and spaces for the community to interact with each other.
Below is a short list of current resources.

- [Package website](https://package.epinowcast.org/): This includes a
  function reference, model outline, and case studies making use of the
  package. The development version of our documentation (corresponding
  to our `develop` branch) is available
  [here](https://package.epinowcast.org/dev/).
- [Organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/): This includes
  links to our other resources as well as guest posts from community
  members and schedules for any related seminars being run by community
  members.
- [Directory of example
  scripts](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/tree/main/inst/examples):
  Not as fleshed out as our complete case studies these scripts are used
  during package development and each showcase a subset of package
  functionality. Often newly introduced features will be explored here
  before surfacing in other areas of our documentation.
- [Community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/): Our community
  forum is where development of tools is discussed, along with related
  research from our members and discussions between users. If you are
  interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease this is likely
  a good place to start regardless of if you end up making use of
  `epinowcast`.

## Installation

### Installing the package

Install the latest released version of the package with:

``` r
install.packages("epinowcast", repos = "https://epinowcast.r-universe.dev")
```

Alternatively, install the stable development version from GitHub using
the following,

``` r
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The unstable development version can also be installed from GitHub using
the following,

``` r
remotes::install_github("epinowcast/epinowcast@develop", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing CmdStan

If you don’t already have CmdStan installed then, in addition to
installing `epinowcast`, it is also necessary to install CmdStan using
CmdStanR’s `install_cmdstan()` function to enable model fitting in
`epinowcast`. A suitable C++ toolchain is also required. Instructions
are provided in the [*Getting started with
CmdStanR*](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html)
vignette. See the [CmdStanR
documentation](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for further details and
support.

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

## Quick start

In this quick start we use COVID-19 hospitalisations by date of positive
test in Germany available up to the 1st of October 2021 to demonstrate
the specification and fitting of a simple nowcasting model using
`epinowcast`. Examples using more complex models are available in the
package vignettes and in the papers linked to in the literature
vignette.

### Package

As well as `epinowcast` this quick start makes use of `data.table` and
`ggplot2` which are both installed when `epinowcast` is installed.

``` r
library(epinowcast)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Data

Nowcasting is effectively the estimation of reporting patterns for
recently reported data. This requires data on these patterns for
previous observations and typically this means the time series of data
as reported on multiple consecutive days (in theory non-consecutive days
could be used but this is not yet supported in `epinowcast`). For this
quick start these data are sourced from the [Robert Koch Institute via
the Germany Nowcasting
hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/wiki/Truth-data#role-an-definition-of-the-seven-day-hospitalization-incidence)
where they are deconvolved from weekly data and days with negative
reported hospitalisations are adjusted.

Below we first filter for a snapshot of retrospective data available 40
days before the 1st of October that contains 40 days of data and then
produce the nowcast target based on the latest available
hospitalisations by date of positive test.

``` r
nat_germany_hosp <-
  germany_covid19_hosp[location == "DE"][age_group %in% "00+"] |>
  enw_filter_report_dates(latest_date = "2021-10-01")

  enw_filter_report_dates(remove_days = 40) |>
  enw_filter_reference_dates(include_days = 40)

### Data preprocessing and model specification

Process reported data into format required for `epinowcast` and return
in a `data.table`. At this stage specify grouping (i.e age, location) if
any. It can be useful to check this output before beginning to model to
make sure everything is as expected.

``` r
pobs <- enw_preprocess_data(retro_nat_germany, max_delay = 40)
pobs
#>                    obs          new_confirm              latest
#> 1: <data.table[860x9]> <data.table[860x11]> <data.table[41x10]>
#>    missing_reference  reporting_triangle      metareference          metareport
#> 1: <data.table[0x6]> <data.table[41x42]> <data.table[41x9]> <data.table[80x12]>
#>             metadelay time snapshots by groups max_delay   max_date
#> 1: <data.table[40x4]>   41        41         1        40 2021-08-22
```

Construct a parametric lognormal intercept only model for the date of
reference using the metadata produced by `enw_preprocess_data()`. Note
that `epinowcast` uses a sparse design matrix for parametric delay
distributions to reduce runtimes so the design matrix shows only unique
rows with `index` containing the mapping to the full design matrix.

``` r
reference_module <- enw_reference(~1, distribution = "lognormal", data = pobs)
```

Construct a model with a random effect for the day of report using the
metadata produced by `enw_preprocess_data()`.

``` r
report_module <- enw_report(~ (1 | day_of_week), data = pobs)
```

Construct a model with a lognormal random walk on expected cases. See
`enw_expectation()` for other suggested choices.

``` r
expectation_module <- enw_expectation(
  ~ 0 + (1 | day), data = pobs
)
```

### Model fitting

First compile the model. This step can be left to `epinowcast` but here
we want to use multiple cores per chain to speed up model fitting and so
need to compile the model with this feature turned on.

``` r
model <- enw_model(threads = TRUE)
```

We now fit the model and produce a nowcast using this fit. Note that
here we use two chains each using two threads as a demonstration but in
general using 4 chains is recommended. Also note that warm-up and
sampling iterations have been set below default values to reduce compute
requirements but this may not be sufficient for many real world use
cases. Finally, note that here we have silenced fitting progress and
potential warning messages for the purposes of keeping this quick start
short but in general this should not be done.

``` r
options(mc.cores = 2)
nowcast <- epinowcast(pobs,
  expectation = expectation_module,
  reference = reference_module,
  report = report_module,
  fit = enw_fit_opts(,
    save_warmup = FALSE, pp = TRUE,
    chains = 2, threads_per_chain = 2,
    iter_sampling = 500, iter_warmup = 500,
    show_messages = FALSE, refresh = 0
  ),
  model = model
)
```

### Results

Print the output from `epinowcast` which includes diagnostic
information, the data used for fitting, and the `cmdstanr` object.

``` r

Plot the summarised nowcast against currently observed data (or
optionally more recent data for comparison purposes).

``` r
plot(nowcast, latest_obs = latest_germany_hosp)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-nowcast-1.png" width="100%" />

Plot posterior predictions for observed notifications by date of report
as a check of how well the model reproduces the observed data.

``` r
plot(nowcast, type = "posterior") +
  facet_wrap(vars(reference_date), scale = "free")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-pp-1.png" width="100%" />

Rather than using the methods supplied for `epinowcast` directly,
package functions can also be used to extract nowcast posterior samples,
summarise them, and then plot them. This is demonstrated here by
plotting the 7 day incidence for hospitalisations.

``` r
# extract samples
samples <- summary(nowcast, type = "nowcast_samples")

# Take a 7 day rolling sum of both samples and observations
cols <- c("confirm", "sample")
samples[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, frollsum, n = 7),
  .SDcols = cols, by = ".draw"
][!is.na(sample)]

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and new contributors! We particularly
appreciate help on priority problems in the
[issues](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/issues). Please check
and add to the issues, and/or add a [pull

guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/epinowcast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information.

If interested in expanding the functionality of the underlying model
note that `epinowcast` allows users to pass in their own models meaning
that alternative parameterisations, for example altering the forecast
model used for inferring expected observations, may be easily tested
within the package infrastructure. Once this testing has been done
alterations that increase the flexibility of the package model and
improves its defaults are very welcome via pull request or other
communication with the package authors. Even if not wanting to add your
updated model to the package please do reach out as we would love to
hear about your use case.
