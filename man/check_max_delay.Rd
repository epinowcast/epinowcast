\usage{
check_max_delay(
  data,
  max_delay = data$max_delay,
  cum_coverage = 0.8,
  maxdelay_quantile_outlier = 0.97,
  warn = TRUE,
  warn_internal = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Output from \code{\link[=enw_preprocess_data]{enw_preprocess_data()}}.}

\item{max_delay}{The maximum number of days to model in the delay
distribution. Must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. Observations
with delays larger then the maximum delay will be dropped. If the specified
maximum delay is too short, nowcasts can be biased as important parts of the
true delay distribution are cut off. At the same time, computational cost
scales non-linearly with this setting, so you want the maximum delay to be as
long as necessary, but not much longer. Consider what delays are realistic
for your application, and when in doubt, check if increasing the maximum
delay noticeably changes the delay distribution or nowcasts as estimated by
epinowcast. If it does, your maximum delay may still be too short.
Note that delays are zero indexed and so include the reference date and
\code{max_delay - 1} other days (i.e. a \code{max_delay} of 1 corresponds to
no delay). You can use \code{\link[=check_max_delay]{check_max_delay()}} to check the coverage of a delay
distribution for different maximum delays.}

\item{cum_coverage}{The aspired percentage of cases that the maximum delay
should cover. Defaults to 0.8 (80\%).}

\item{maxdelay_quantile_outlier}{Only reference dates sufficiently far in
the past, determined based on the maximum observed delay, are included (see
details). Instead of the overall maximum observed delay, a quantile of the
maximum observed delay over all reference dates is used. This is more robust
against outliers. Defaults to 0.97 (97\%).}

\item{warn}{Should a warning be issued if the cumulative case count is
below \code{cum_coverage} for the majority of reference dates?}

\item{warn_internal}{Should only be \code{TRUE} if this function is called
internally by another \code{epinowcast} function. Then, warnings are adjusted to
avoid confusing the user.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the share of reference dates where the
cumulative case count is below \code{cum_coverage}, stratified by group.
}
\description{
Check if maximum delay specified by the user is long enough and
raise potential warnings. This is achieved by computing the share of
reference dates where the cumulative case count is below some aspired
coverage.
}
\details{
The coverage is with respect to the maximum observed case count for
the corresponding reference date. As the maximum observed case count is
likely smaller than the true overall case count for not yet fully observed
reference dates (due to right truncation), only reference dates that are
more than the maximum observed delay ago are included. Still, because we
can only use the maximum observed delay, not the unknown true maximum
delay, the computed coverage values should be interpreted with care, as they
are only proxies for the true coverage.
