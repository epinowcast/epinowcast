\title{Convert structural reporting data.table to nested list of matrices}
\usage{
.structural_reporting_to_matrices(structural, pobs)
}
\arguments{
\item{structural}{A \code{data.table} with columns \code{.group}, \code{date},
\code{report_date}, and \code{report}.}

\item{pobs}{Preprocessed observation list containing max_delay.}
}
\value{
A nested list: list(groups) of list(times) of matrices
(max_delay x max_delay). Each matrix contains 0s and 1s indicating
which delays aggregate to which reporting delays.
}
\description{
Takes a structural reporting data.table and converts it to the nested
list structure required by \code{.convert_structural_to_arrays()}. This
involves creating delay columns and splitting by group and date.
